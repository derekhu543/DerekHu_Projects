So I arrive at 6 AM and I‚Äôm greeted by the manager who brings me to where we are going to begin. As we are walking by the punch in clock, he says ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to punch in until 8:30‚Äù

Me being young and Naive, I didn‚Äôt say anything. I finished training then punched in at 8:30. I assumed that I‚Äôd be getting paid for the extra 2 and a half hours and that it‚Äôs easier for them to put it in the system manually.

Yesterday when I got my paycheck, I noticed my pay was the exact same as every other week (I always work the same hours)

I work at a nursing home as a cna. I have two children . a 17 year old, and a 3-year-old. Sometimes when my kids get sick I have to go pick them up or not go into work that day. Lately my little one has been getting sick easily which the school won't take her if she's vomiting or has a temperature. Especially since we just recently got out of the pandemic. But anyway my job has a new director. He's trying to get everybody on the same page of coming in on time and really punishing the ones that call out often. Now I don't call out a lot but my kids do come first. And I don't have anyone else to watch my little one. Her father works during the day at the same time when I do and my parents have cancer right now. so there's no way they could watch her if she's sick. So, my daughter gets sick again with 101 temperature and vomiting. I call out within the time that is allowed which is 2 hours prior to my shift. I get a call back from my director saying that's unacceptable and that I have to be in at work. If I don't, I will get written yup he told me I should take it seriously because after a write-up it's suspension and then being fired.
 So, You want me to come into work? Okay! cue malicious compliance. Sadly I packed my sick little girl in the car with a lunch bag and activities as well as her pack and play and toys. Also a diaper bag. You can guess where this is going. I walked into work with my daughter and bags in tow. I walked into my supervisor's office and I told him her daily routine. When she eats, what the password is on her tablet, also when she takes a nap. he looks at me confused. He says ""wait a minute what are you doing I can't watch her!"" 
 I tell him ""well I can't either! I have to be on the floor doing my job that you refuse to let me call out of today. So you will be watching my daughter. By the way she's been vomiting every couple hours, so make sure she stays hydrated."" Just then, my daughter throws up on the floor. Not a lot, but enough to show that she obviously was sick. She starts to cry. He tells me that he's sorry, and he made a mistake and I am okay to leave. After this, I left and took her to the doctor to get her looked over. She's fine she just has a bad cold which is making her vomit. I figured if he fired me I would just collect unemployment temporarily and possibly talk to a lawyer about being fired wrongfully. But hopefully after this situation, he will put thought into a mother calling off for her sick child."

The Fox is Guarding the Hen House: The SEC is allowing the OCC unlimited access to money in pension funds and insurance companies,Superstonk,3110,x56h7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x56h7d/the_fox_is_guarding_the_hen_house_the_sec_is/,133,1662243616.0,"This is in response to [The SEC ‚Äúno objection‚Äù to OCC proposals may not be as bad as you think](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x4w74c/the_sec_no_objection_to_occ_proposals_may_not_be/) which plays Devil's Advocate to my post [SEC: ""No Objection"" to OCC Proposals so MOASS can happen, pensions pay for it, and Wall St keeps their collateral](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x4hezj/sec_no_objection_to_occ_proposals_so_moass_can/).

On the upside, [u/dmurrieta72](https://www.reddit.com/user/dmurrieta72/) and I both agree that:

1. Clearing Members can still default,
2. The SEC proposals are about how the OCC handles a Clearing Member default (""Aftermath""),
3. And, we're both **bullish**.

# So, how bad are these OCC proposals?

In particular, how much of the $35+ Trillion in pensions funds can the OCC tap?  $1 Billion?  $2.5 Billion?  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It's undisputed that the OCC is looking to add **$2.5 billion** in external liquidity:

[SR-OCC-2022-803 34-95327 pg 8](https://preview.redd.it/tmt8xlr4mpl91.png?width=1666&format=png&auto=webp&s=97f698a02041c60413de830c6d41cf8d22039ced)

And, here's where the OCC says ""well, that $2.5 billion *might* all come from the Non-Bank Liquidity Facility"":

[SR-OCC-2022-803 34-95327 pg 9](https://preview.redd.it/k5wr4s0ompl91.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=0334de698f7bd272c354d4e3e1d3c78e4ab9b792)

Basically, if banks don't want to give us money, we'll go to our Non-Bank Liquidity Facility which taps institutional investors that *are not Clearing Members or an affiliated bank, such as pension funds or insurance companies:*

[SR-OCC-2022-803 34-95327 pg 5](https://preview.redd.it/ziw7gj8dnpl91.png?width=1686&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ecd67128139ab23b71d65a6c192f92193b237c2)

Increasing the OCC's ability to tap pensions funds and insurance companies for $2.5 billion dollars is only an increase from their current ability to tap them for $1 billion dollars.  And currently, to get access to more money, the OCC needs to ask permission to exceed the current $1 billion dollar cap.

Which is why the OCC is also asking for ""Removing the present $1 billion dollar cap to the Non-Bank Liquidity Facility program"".

[SR-OCC-2022-803 34-95327 \\""Proposed Change\\"" pg 9 ](https://preview.redd.it/qx1ust2gopl91.png?width=1682&format=png&auto=webp&s=cecb5ea8f1a3d5b68ddafe5a954c3d9a16073c21)

After all, if you're going to ask to more than double your access to money from pension funds and insurance companies, you might as well ask to remove the limits and not have to ask again.  And that's what they did:

[SR-OCC-2022-803 34-95327 \\""Anticipated Effect On and Management of Risk\\"" pls 12-13](https://preview.redd.it/qphj0fyropl91.png?width=1644&format=png&auto=webp&s=65bff623e5a067aa2d07a0e13b5bbd3f90eeedd9)

Basically, the OCC is asking to up their limit from $1 billion to $2.5 billion *and* remove the pesky limit to ""allow OCC to seek an aggregate commitment amount for up to the amount determined by the Board of the Directors"".

>*OCC: Can we remove the limits and just use however much we decide is necessary?*  
>  
>*SEC: Sure thing.  We trust you bro!*  
>  
>Apes: üôàüôàüôàüôàüôà

The SEC understood the OCC's proposal the same way, ""OCC is proposing to remove the $1 billion funding limit and **increase the capacity of its Non-Bank Liquidity Facility to an amount to be determined by OCC's Board** from time to time, based on OCC's liquidity needs"":

&#x200B;

[SR-OCC-2022-803 34-95670 pg 4](https://preview.redd.it/i3lx0dprppl91.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0b037fe405558a551bcc948d233be6251c211cc)

*The fox is guarding the hen house.*  **OCC's Board decides the OCC's funding limit from pension funds and insurance companies in their Non-Bank Liquidity Facility.**

Pension funds were valued at over [$35 TRILLION (as of 2020)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/421729/pension-funds-assets-usa/). The OCC's Board now decides how much of that the OCC can access.  The OCC *was limited* to $1 billion and they asked to up that limit to $2.5 billion *and remove the limit*.  The SEC has granted OCC's request to remove the limit because the ""OCC has been designated as a SIFMU"" (Systemically Important Financial Market Utility \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_market_utility), [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systemically-important-financial-institution-sifi.asp), [OCC](https://www.theocc.com/newsroom/insights/2018/10-29-the-importance-of-a-systemically-important-f), [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/designated_fmu_about.htm)\])  Basically, the US Government will protect it *at all costs*.  Regardless of whatever perverse incentives this creates for financial industry participants to lie, cheat, steal, **sell assets that don't exist**, **or fail to deliver on securities sold**.

[SR-OCC-2022-803 34-95670 pgs 14-15](https://preview.redd.it/79em3oacrpl91.png?width=1702&format=png&auto=webp&s=06432cba72d0ea656e216bdfe58878e90fc696f1)

# Tapping pension funds and insurance companies is an alternative to their Wall St friends selling precious collateral

The OCC's stated intention for their proposed change was very clear:

[SR-OCC-2022-803 34-95327 pg 15](https://preview.redd.it/gu5vdp0ktpl91.png?width=1696&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc36c7ee6f027b3ed5a4f5217138f5f7440572cc)

>""\[T\]he proposed change would **allow OCC to seek a readily available liquidity resource** that would enable it to, among other things, continue to meet its obligations in a timely fashion and **as an alternative to selling Clearing Member collateral under what may be stressed and volatile market conditions**.""

The OCC explicitly stated their proposal expanding the Non-Bank Liquidity Facility (with pension funds and insurance companies) is ""**an alternative to selling Clearing Member collateral** ~~under what may be stressed and volatile market conditions~~"" during a market crash. The SEC approved it. ***What is the point of having Clearing Member collateral???***

Why pensions and insurance companies?  I covered this before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/utlh7m/kenny_destroying_teacher_pensions_and_blaming_apes/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/v26rya/moass_confirmed_by_ken_griffin/) . **Wall St made sure Main St pays their gambling debts, again.**  Privatized Profits & Socialized Losses -- it's on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privatizing-profits-and-socializing-losses.asp).

To those who suggest we are ‚Äúreductive and insulting‚Äù to young women when warning about age gaps,TwoXChromosomes,7060,x4zcbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/x4zcbu/to_those_who_suggest_we_are_reductive_and/,660,1662224619.0,"Whenever the age gap discussions come up about the predatory nature of being an older, established man targeting barely legal women, it never fails to bring out the ridiculous arguments:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being reductive to young women to suggest they can‚Äôt make informed decisions!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being misogynistic and suggesting they shouldn‚Äôt be ALLOWED to date an older man‚Äù (this one I have no doubt is the actual predators just trying to reframe the discussion to their benefit. No one ever suggests forcing women to do/not do anything)

‚ÄúOlder women are just jealous of the attention and want to make the men marry them!‚Äù

Do you realize that most older women (or any woman in her twenties) have all heard that exact same garbage from the predators they encountered growing up?

Most of use encountered men at some point in our teens (surely you‚Äôve seen the number of women who say they got the most street harassment from men in their early to late teens. 13-16 for me) who say the exact same garbage you do

35 year old man chatting up 13 year old me online ‚Äúyeah you‚Äôre so mature for your age. People act like you can‚Äôt make your own choice‚Äù

21 year old man chatting up also 13 year old me ‚Äúyeah older women are just fucking jealous of you guys because you‚Äôre still hot and the men want you‚Äù

40 year old man to 15 year old me ‚Äúyeah I remember this 14 year old girl that a dude got in trouble for fucking. She totally knew what she was doing. She wanted it. No one forced these girls to do anything‚Äù

30 year old to 17 year old me ‚ÄúMuH aGe oF cOnSeNt‚Äù

No one is falling for it. You‚Äôre largely talking to women who have seen and heard it all already. We aren‚Äôt debating you on whether age gaps with barely legals is ‚Äúokay‚Äù we are fucking TELLING you sickos it‚Äôs predatory and how it either happened to us or men attempted it on us

And when it wasn‚Äôt us, we had friends and classmates who went through it. 12 year old girls with 19 year old boyfriends. 18 year old girls graduating to date/marry their teacher

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs legal‚Äù shouts the predators and those that defend them

Yeah it‚Äôs legal in some places to fuck a 12 year old. Child marriage is even legal in the US. Legal isn‚Äôt moral. Power dynamics matter. Status matters. Motives matter. The older established adult will have advantages over a barely legal that the barely legal often doesn‚Äôt comprehend.

If you legitimately believed you were helping or making some kind of legit argument, I‚Äôm here to tell you, you‚Äôre not. You‚Äôre parroting the same shit our groomers and attempted groomers tried on us. The rest of you are just predators trying to protect the status quo

You try to frame experienced older women giving warnings and lessons as ‚Äújealous‚Äù older women wanting the men for themselves

The last thing any woman wants is the kind of man that even considers a barely legal

ETA:

I wanted to recommend the new Hulu documentary ‚Äúkeep this between us‚Äù about women who were groomed by their teachers.

It talks a lot as well about our cultures sexualization of young women and teens and romanticizing of age gaps with older men."

Porch piracy has been horrible in my neighborhood lately. Basically if you aren't home to immediately claim your package, it will be stolen. Nothing is really being done about it by the police despite there being a lot of proof from various home security cameras, so I took matters into my own hands. 

I don't have the time or skill to make one of those complex glitter bombs or anything, but I wanted to send a message to these people somehow. My solution? Fill a water bottle with pee, tightly pack it into the box so it won't move, and lightly tape the cap on instead of twisting it. That way as soon as the box is opened, the cap comes off and piss spills everywhere. It's stupid but effective, and what are the thieves gonna do about it? Tell the police they stole a package that had pee in it?

I started doing this earlier this week and after the first 2 got stolen, I'm now able to leave one of these traps front and center on the porch all day without it being stolen."

Karen at swim lesson because I told her husband the whole pool can see his naked body,FuckYouKaren,975,x5a5uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckYouKaren/comments/x5a5uf/karen_at_swim_lesson_because_i_told_her_husband/,165,1662254187.0,"A few weeks ago I took my kiddo to swim lesson. My in-laws joined me because they love seeing kiddo swim. While watching kiddo, my MIL noticed a man showering in the showers that are in the pool area. There is a curtain on the shower stall, but the shower‚Äôs purpose is to be there to rinse off before going into the pool, not to shower naked in.

My MIL then notices the man opening the curtain and she could see E V E R Y T H I N G. He did this multiple times to grab some things in a backpack. My FIL is full on WTF mode and I‚Äôm sitting there like, kids are in the pool they could see this man‚Äôs dingaling which is not OK. There are crazy people in this area who would love to call the cops on this man. Does this man know that we can see everything or that there are state of the art locker rooms available for showering in? Does he know that  he can use them since he was swimming in the pool for lessons?

So I wait until he is done and when he is walking out I casually go up to him and just say ‚Äúhey man, just a heads up, when you were getting things out of your bag, we could see your naked body. There are fancy locker rooms down the hall in the basement area to shower in naked. There are kids here and it‚Äôs best to shower there next time.‚Äù He looks at me just dumbfounded and walks away. I thought that was the end of it.

Then enters the Karen. This man goes and gets his wife (with a four year old girl on her hip) and the employee of the complex and they come to me when I‚Äôm watching my kid swim and the employee just lets this women yell at me. Here is the conversation:

Karen (K) ‚ÄúDo you work here?‚Äù

Me: ‚Äúno. It‚Äôs pretty obvious that I‚Äôm here watching my kid swim‚Äù

K: ‚Äúwell then WHO ARE YOU TO TELL MY HUSBAND WHERE TO SHOWER? YOU DONT WORK HERE. MY HUSBAND DOES NOT NEED TO LISTEN TO YOU!‚Äù

Me: ‚Äúwell, I could see -‚Äú

K: ‚ÄúYOU DONT WORK HERE YOU DONT TELL MY HUSBAND WHAT TO DO!‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúI COULD SEE HIS PENIS SO COULD HAVE MY CHILD OR ANYONE ELSE HERE. WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF-‚Äú

K: ‚ÄúYOU STILL DONT WORK HERE‚Äù

Then she huffs and puffs away. Her husband just stands behind her like a wimp.

The employee talks to us and I inform her what actually happened. She talked to the parents and they still use the showers in the pool area, but they put a chair in there with the curtain around it so then we don‚Äôt see anything but still, the locker rooms are like out of the movies nice and it‚Äôs an appropriate place to be naked. Use that!

The reason why I didn‚Äôt just go to the employee was because he could have left and I would have to deal with all that next week.

Edit: he was opening the curtain to grab stuff out of his backpack. I put it in the post too."

1. Setup a Google App Password on the Google account to be shared. https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en-GB

2. On the other person‚Äôs iOS device, add a new CalDav account using the previously created Google App Password. https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/set-up-mail-contacts-and-calendar-accounts-ipha0d932e96/ios

Any rich sleaze bag can buy a private plane or an expensive boat, a private submarine on the other hand, now that's flaunting wealth. (Well have the extra benefit of not having to see these rich assholes!) 

A NICE private submarine could easily easily dwarf the amount of money that it costs to get even the most expensive private planes and super yachts. The engineering to build something to withstand the immense pressure of traveling underwater could easily rack up a large bill. Personally I would find it far more impressive to see pictures of some rich dude taking a gym, a hot tub, a restaurant and bar, and whatever else these rich people bring on their planes and boats, down under water.

Edit: 

Even the US military, who, for all intents and purposes, practically has an unlimited budget, still needs to resurface for supplies. Submarines are only limited by the amount of food on board, they eventually have to resurface for resupply."

Ten years later and they lost everything to 2020 bankruptcy, so they broke into my home to squat while I was away",entitledparents,10810,x4tlhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/x4tlhf/parents_booted_me_out_at_18_and_left_me_homeless/,441,1662209168.0,"This is a rant story. And I just need a place to vent this. I don't want to reveal any details that would get me recognized. Especially by my parents if they happen to be on Reddit. So please, no one ask for any details I don't already provide in this post.

I'm 30-male, and my parents didn't really want kids. I was an only child, and pretty much an accidental pregnancy from what relatives have told me as my parents claimed that they were going to be child-free when they married. My childhood was initially good. But I think after I started growing out of the cute and adorable phase, my parents were less inclined to spend time with me. They both worked, and had their own business that they started together. That business was their life, and I was ALWAYS second fiddle to it! Any other close members of family like my grandparents lived states away, and I barely knew anything about them till I was an adult. So I had no other family around my entire childhood. I was practically raised by TV and my school teachers. My own birthdays by the time I became a teenager were often spent without my parents as they'd just give me some money and tell me to go out and buy whatever I wanted. It was more or less the same with Christmas, and sometimes even back to school shopping. We wouldn't have even had a Christmas tree after I turned 10 if it weren't for the fact I convinced my parents to buy a fake one I could build up and then take apart later every year. If I were to describe my parents. Think of them as those people who always wear black, drink lots of wine, and look down their noses at people. And the last I saw of my parents, they still looked and acted the same way. Although my father was always wearing a toup√©e now.

When I turned 16 I asked my parents if I could work part time for them at their business. And they just told me they had no open positions or anything like that. They may as well have just come right out and said they didn't want me there. After I turned 18 my parents told me that since I was an adult, they expected me to move out as soon as I was able. I was working part time because I was still in high school. And I didn't have anywhere near enough saved for college. And not long after high school ended my parents told me to pack up and move out. They got an official eviction notice that gave me 30 days and everything. They didn't even help me move. I had to get help from a friend's dad who owns a truck. I ended up renting a crappy apartment and working retail. I had no real life experience and no time for college. Then after just a few months I got fired because my manager legitimately had it out for me and wrote me up for the stupidest things. I don't even remember what they were anymore. But I wasn't the only one the manager treated that way. I called corporate about it and so did a few other people. Corporate looked into the manager, and they were soon fired for various reasons. Not many of which I actually know since it was mostly kept quiet. But someone told me theft of cigarettes was a part of it. And the manager was a chain smoker. Corporate refused to rehire me and only said that they'd change the record to say I was laid off instead of terminated so my resume would still be clean. Guess they considered me damaged goods or something. I ended up going broke pretty fast because I was terrible at managing my own money and couldn't find steady employment. So I lost my apartment. I went back to my parents begging for help, but they refused to take me in. Not even for a little while to get back on my feet. I ended up homeless and living out of a tent in someone's back yard, in winter. My friends had all moved on to college, some in other states, and I was a broke kid taking whatever work I could to stay alive.

My salvation came when one of the neighbors of my parents found out I was living out of a tent and offered to take me in for a little while so I wouldn't freeze. She helped me badger my parents into telling me how to get in touch with the other members of my estranged family. My parents did not want to say. My guess is out of fear of being judged for throwing their son out the way they did. But they coughed up the info and gave me a list of contact details. And then told me not to bother them ever again. I called my grandparents from my father's side of the family, and they were very surprised and happy to hear from me because they hadn't seen me since I was an infant. And I'm their only grandchild. My grandparents after finding out my situation, flew me over to live with them as soon as they could. They basically adopted me. My parents didn't even see me off at the airport despite being invited to. I had zero contact with them for pretty much a decade. My grandparents said they despised my parents for treating me so poorly, and legally disowned them by striking them from their wills. My parents I'm told were not happy to hear that. But also said it didn't really matter because they were plenty well off and didn't need anything from my grandparents. How wrong that statement turned out to be.

After about a year of living with my grandparents I was able to afford to start going to community college. I got an associates degree, got a decent job thanks to a recommendation from my grandpa, and eventually my grandparents offered to sell me their house so they could retire to Arizona. My grandma wanted to live in a warmer climate as the cold winter was getting harder and harder on her health every year. I was sad to see them go. But I happily bought the house. They sold it to me for one-third it's value. And I'll have it paid off in a few more years. My job has me going away on the road periodically. So I can end up away from home for weeks at a time. Not that I mind the travel. I have no pets or a girlfriend, or anything like that. I wouldn't have time for them right now. But in a few years when I have some things in order I'll make time. I don't want to stay a lonely bachelor forever.

Then one day in late 2020 I came home after being away for over two weeks, only to find a large white van I did not recognize in my driveway. I was getting ready to call police when I noticed the van had the logo from my parents' business on the side of it. And I felt dread. Yes my parents were there. They'd broken in somehow and were living out of my home. And they had the nerve to greet me like we were buddy/buddy the moment I walked in. I told them to get the hell out, and they refused because it was grandma and grandpa's house. I said it wasn't their house anymore. They'd sold it to me when they retired. They'd have known that if they were in any way involved with my life. But they threw me to the wolves ten years prior with no life experience. We argued and they refused to leave. My father told me it was his parents' house first. And that meant he and my mother had the right to live there if they wanted. I walked right into my bedroom, locked the door and called the police. When the cops showed up they were of no help. My parents claimed to them that they had already been there long enough to have residency, which was a complete lie. But I had no cameras to prove they weren't there a month. My neighbors had no cameras either. So it was my word against my parents over how long they'd really been there, and they were claiming squatter's rights. They told police they had a verbal rental agreement with me, and that I was trying to illegally evict them for no reason. My mother even put on the waterworks when saying that. The police told me it was a family dispute, and to file eviction with the courts to get them out. And this was in 2020. Getting to court for anything took longer because of the pandemic. Meanwhile my parents are squatting in my house rent free and rubbing it in my face.

From the information I got out of them, their business went bankrupt and they sold off almost everything they had to pay their debts. All they had left was the van and a few personal belongings. So they expected to live in my house rent free for the foreseeable future. They were working too. Both of them soon got new jobs. My father as a delivery driver, my mother as a sales associate. They were making money, and the only things they contributed to was electricity and water utilities. Which was basically just handing me a $100 bill every month and saying I should be grateful they were paying me anything. Any time I tried to discuss proper rent with them, they just said I owed it to them to live rent free because I took 18 years of their lives. And it's not like they were demanding the money back for that time. Then threatened to stop helping with the utilities all together. I was so at my wits end that I ended up calling my grandparents to explain the situation to them. They were very unhappy, and spoke with my parents. But my parents still said they had the right to stay in my home. And refused to budge. My grandpa told me he was sorry it'd come to this. And that if they hadn't sold me the house, my parents wouldn't have invaded. I told him not to worry. I'd already filed for a legal eviction, and would get it soon enough. And my parents already knew that they were on borrowed time. I made sure to say that in earshot of my parents too. They responded with the silent treatment.

My father was away most of the time driving a delivery vehicle 6 days a week, which was a job really not to his liking. And my mother basically tried to take over my house in her spare time. She demanded I let her rearrange my living room, and even tried to force me to give her and my father the master bedroom, because they were my parents, and they deserved better, as she put it. I vetoed both of those things and said they don't deserve better, and to stop trying to act like I owe them anything. I didn't ask to be born. And it's a normal obligation for parents to raise their own children. And all they were doing was trying to assert dominance to try and keep me from kicking them out. Finally after four months and now into early 2021, I managed to take my parents to court over their squatting. We only needed to go to court because they fought the eviction and tried to gaslight me into rescinding it. They tried to use the fact it was formerly my grandparents' house, and the fact that they were giving me $100 a month as some sort of leverage of residency. But there was no real rental agreement. And they were smart enough not to try and forge one as that would have been fraud. So the judge ordered that they needed to be out in a maximum of 30 days because they have zero claim on my house. After court they confronted me and said they were disappointed in me for kicking out my own flesh and blood. I couldn't help but laugh and called them hypocrites because that's exactly what they did to me without a care in the world for my well-being. They had no love for me, so I have no love for them. I owed them nothing. They just tried to act like everything that was mine is theirs. But they had no right to call themselves my parents because they've never really acted like it. I called them a pair of snobby lying narcissists to their faces, and told them to get their affairs in order. Because they already know I won't hesitate to call police if they don't leave my house when the 30 days are over. My father looked enraged. But my mother stopped him from saying or doing anything by grabbing his shoulder and shaking her head. He sneered at me and walked away.

They left. But not without a lot of tension. That final month was spent with them either guilting me to try and make me change my mind, or completely ignoring me. I put up a calendar in the living room and checked off each day before they had to leave with a red marker. And the exact day they were to be out was marked with a big red circle. I still remember that final day was March 2nd. My parents waited until the exact day they had to leave my home for good before they finally left. Even when all their stuff was out of the house and they were sleeping on the floor in the guest room for a few days. Since they were so convinced they could make me let them stay, they didn't bother to try and look for an apartment until after the court eviction went through. And my mother spent weeks scrambling to find an apartment. They had to get a tiny and crappy studio apartment in the next city over because it was the only thing they could find on such short notice. A lot like what I had to do when I was 18. Quite ironic. I drove my mother over to see it once, and the apartment was terrible. The walls were baby barf green, the carpet looked like it was 20 years old, the only window just had a view of a brick wall outside, there was no dishwasher, the stove was the smallest one I'd ever seen, and the toilet looked like it really needed to be replaced. The walls also did little to stop noise from neighbors. There was already two people loudly fighting in the adjacent apartment while we were there. My mother went out of her way to try and give me sad looks while dropping hints that I should be feeling guilty that I was reducing them to live in such a place. But I just acted oblivious to it all until she finally stopped. They signed the lease right away and moved what little stuff they had into the apartment over the weekend. They also ended up demanding the queen size bed, dresser and flat screen TV from my guest room. I told them to just take the damn things because I no longer wanted them in the house after they spent 5 months sleeping in that room. They looked at me like I was treating them as though they were diseased and demanded nothing more.

The moment they had to leave for good, I started changing the locks on all exterior doors. All their stuff was at the apartment, and they'd spent their last night in my guest room. They watched me start ripping the old lock off the front door as they were getting into the van. They said nothing, I said nothing. But they just sat and watched me for a while until I had the new door knob on. Then they finally left. I breathed a massive sigh of relief the second that van went down the road. I figured karma had finally come for them, and they could live under a rock for all I cared. But nope, my grandparents heard from them recently. They'd called them to brag that had a new business similar to their old one in the same state as I'm living in now. And they are basically on track to be right back to where they used to be in life prior to the pandemic. Which was making good money and looking down on others. I've already googled their new business. And it seems like it's doing well. They have many positive reviews and everything. I'm pretty friggin resentful truth be told. They put me through being homeless, squatted for next to free at my house for months, then went right back to being the snobby wine drinking business people they used to be. If karma is real, it's taking too damn long.

Edit: I would like to thank everyone for all the constructive advice. And many of the points that are being made on selling the house I'm realizing have merit. I've asked my grandparents if it'd be a good idea if I moved closer to them. They told me that if I wanna sell the house, then to go right ahead. My parents will have no clue where I am if I move away. So I'm heavily considering it now. I'm gonna see if the company I work for can transfer me down south. I think I wouldn't mind the warmer climate anyway. I've hated winter since the time I had to live in a tent. I don't have many friends where I currently am as I'm kind of a loner. So it wouldn't be too hard to start over somewhere farther away. I'm attached to this house. But it's not like I grew up in it. So I will consider moving.

Yes I understand the need for more cameras, and will be looking into that. As for those wondering how my parents broke in and fooled police. Well it's stupidly simple. My parents got in through a window I forgot to lock. They just pulled the screen off and opened it to get right in. Then they found my spare house keys I kept hanging on a hook near the kitchen and copied them. When claiming squatter's rights to police as well as saying we had a prior verbal agreement, my parents presented working house keys to the cops and lied their little asses off saying I'd let them move in. My parents had also already filed for an address change with the DMV online before I'd even gotten home, and showed police a printout of that they'd made. And said that their new IDs with my address were soon to be in the mail. The cops just looked annoyed, told me it was a domestic issue, and to file to evict them like a ""normal"" person. I wish I'd gotten their badge numbers to report them. 

Small Addition: Yes my parents had their mail redirected to my house. Which is another thing they used to claim residency. The thing is that if they'd lived in my house for more than 30 days with permission, squatter's rights would make them tenants. They claimed they had my permission and used every dirty trick at their disposal to convince police they had the right to be there. There was no way for them to confirm or deny how long my parents had been living in the house. And it turned into a situation of everybody pointing fingers and police didn't know who to believe. That's why I had to go to court to evict them.

I did refuse to give my parents the wifi password while they lived with me though since they were not contributing to that utility. However they just used their smartphones to run a mobile hot spot and got internet that way the whole time they were squatting in my house.

Those of you saying that I should leave bad reviews, or expose my parents' past. There really is no point. I'm gonna take the high road there and just forget about them. However if they committed fraud to start that new business of theirs. Then I'll get some popcorn when that comes back on them. Because they'd inevitably call someone for help."

There‚Äôs a lot of unhoused people in my area. (I choose this term because I believe most of these people are victims, stemming back from Reagan era politics. But that‚Äôs not the point of this post). 

Today I passed by a guy who seemed in particularly bad shape. I offered him the $2 cash I had on me (I never carry cash). He said, ‚ÄúSir, I can‚Äôt accept that‚Äù. 

I wasn‚Äôt prepared for this. I said ‚Äúno, please. Take it‚Äù. 

He said ‚ÄúNo sir. I just want some juice‚Äù. 

I said ‚ÄúOrange juice? Is orange juice ok?‚Äù

He looked at me like I was offering him
the fucking Moon

Guys, it broke my heart.

I said ‚Äúyeah man. I‚Äôll get you some orange juice‚Äù. 

So I walk to my corner store and grab what I was there for plus an orange juice and a banana. 

I walk back and hand the guy the orange juice, banana, and the $2.

He looked at me like no one has ever looked at me before. The gratitude, guys. I haven‚Äôt ever been looked at like that‚Ä¶

Then he grabbed a small bowl of broken glass shards. Blue, green, clear. The way he handled it made me understand these were very special to him. 

He said ‚Äúplease, take whatever you want‚Äù

Fucking glass shards you guys!!!!

I‚Äôm not gonna lie, this crushed me. ALL THIS MAN WANTED WAS AN ORANGE JUICE. But I kept it together. 

I said ‚Äúno man. You keep that. It‚Äôs clearly very special. You keep that‚Äù

He nodded and thanked me and we went on our separate ways. 

Guys, I immediately burst into tears. 

I live in the richest country in the world. A country that would kick this man and steal his glass shards if it meant there was a profit. 

This is why I will always Diamond Hand. What the fuck is my measly investment off my shitty wages to me, compared to this man‚Äôs self respect and dignity!? 

I‚Äôm Diamond handing to the end. Because people need us too. 

FUCK THE FINANCIAL TERRORISTS.

i was in a neighbouring city, bored as hell with around 10 bucks. 
i was looking to buy some Xanax but no one had, my bus was about to leave in about 10 minutes so i started to get desperate. 
my friends found this junkie who might have Xanax, so i went up to him and asked, he replied with
 ¬´i only have horse¬ª 
i thought he meant ket so i asked him how much i could get for 10 bucks.
he replied 
¬´1 line¬ª. 
i took out the money and gave it to him.  he started to prepare me the line and immediately i noticed that the ¬´ket¬ª i was buying from him looked like brown sugar and so i asked him 
¬´what tf is that¬ª 
he replied 
¬´heroin¬ª 
i was shocked but i had very little time to register what was happening so i just took it with me and left..

once i got home my heart sank realising what i had just done, i tried to resist the urge to take it but i caved in.
i prepared the line and started filming explaining that this would be the first and last time i would do heroin and did it.

immediately i felt a huge wave of euphoria sweep me off my feet following extreme nausea and disappointment in myself. i just layed there for 2 hours in absolute bliss while still being extremely depressed that i had finally gone over the line i had promised myself would never cross.

i want to tell people my experience but im afraid to be called a junkie. this was a one time experience that i will never repeat ever again.

thank you for reading <3

But I didn't retire!!!,ProRevenge,356,x5dz8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/x5dz8h/but_i_didnt_retire/,19,1662266012.0,"My friend (I'll call her Sandy) worked at a travel agency in British Columbia, Canada. It was a small, owner-operated business with the owner and three employees including my friend. Everyone worked Monday to Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. 

One of my friend's coworkers (I'll call her Jane), an older woman in her early to mid-sixties, was a long-time nuisance employee. Among other sketchy behaviour, Jane was always scamming ways to take time off over and above her official paid vacation time. In order to make up for the lost hours, she would claim overtime hours/pay by supposedly going in to the office in her off hours ""to finish up"" work without being requested by the owner to do so.

Despite being caught in her own lies on a number of occasions and being warned about trying to claim for unsanctioned overtime, the owner of the travel agency was reluctant to officially reprimand Jane or get rid of her. The reason being is the owner discovered after she had hired Jane that Jane had actually been fired from her previous job at another local travel agency for pulling the same stunts; however, Jane had sued her former employer for unfair dismissal and had won a settlement.

After a few years of my friend Sandy working at the travel agency, the owner was ready to retire and offered to sell the business to my friend. Sandy took her up on the deal and took over the business while keeping on Jane and the other employee. Once again, just as the previous owner was afraid to get rid of Jane, so was Sandy for fear of being sued.

When Sandy took over the business, she instituted guidelines regarding taking time off and she established an official ""no overtime"" policy. Jane would still try with her shenanigans but was far less successful in getting what she wanted with my friend in charge. However, Jane still had one trick up her sleeve when she wanted to take time off on a whim. Sandy was a divorced single mom of two boys who were heavily involved in youth hockey. She would sometimes leave the office an hour or two before closing to get her boys to hockey practice or a game. In order to avoid requesting in person and potentially being denied, Jane would wait for Sandy to be out of the office to book a day off if she didn't feel like coming into work or had made plans. Sandy would then arrive at work the next morning only to discover that Jane wasn't coming in. 

Despite this happening a number of times, Sandy would usually let it slide since there was now a definite ""no overtime"" policy. Therefore, Jane could no longer claim to come in to work on the weekend or after hours in order to try and make up for the day off. She would either miss out on a day's pay, in turn saving Sandy money as the owner, or it would come out of her remaining paid vacation days. Moreover, two people in the office at one time could usually handle everything. Jane not coming in was really a no-loss situation for Sandy.

There was one time, however, when Sandy was going to be away for one or two work days just before the weekend to take her boys to a hockey tournament. She told both Jane and the other employee both verbally and in writing that they could not book time off for the dates in question since she would be away and needed both of them in the office. Within a few days of giving this notice, Sandy went in to the office on a Saturday to do some paperwork and go through the sales for the week. This is when she discovered that, only the day before, Jane had booked a trip for her daughter and son-in-law to Las Vegas as well as a plane ticket in her name to Calgary where her daughter lived. Both the trip to Vegas and the ticket to Calgary coincided with the dates Sandy would be out of the office. Sandy then checked the vacation booking schedule to further discover that Jane had indeed booked the days off that she had expressly been told she couldn't have.

Not mentioning she had discovered the travel Jane had booked for herself and her daughter, Sandy emailed Jane telling her she would have to deny her the days off since she had already been told they were unavailable because she (Sandy) would be away and needed Jane in the office. Through a continued series of email exchanges, Jane replied and outright lied to Sandy with some excuse about her daughter getting some long-awaited medical treatment or surgery, and she needed to go to Calgary to help out for a few days and look after her granddaughter. Sandy replied to this lie by telling Jane she knew about the trip she had booked to Vegas for her daughter and son-in-law; that Jane's trip to Calgary was most likely to babysit her granddaughter while her daughter was in Vegas; and that she would still have to deny Jane the days off especially since she booked them after being told they were unavailable.

Jane countered in her subsequent reply, without even addressing the fact that she had been caught in a lie, that she had been a dedicated employee of the travel agency for several years and couldn't understand why she was being treated so unfairly after all she had done for the business. She then wrote that since she wasn't being treated as a valued employee, she had no choice but to retire and was giving her two-weeks' notice. Despite Jane's threat, Sandy replied that she would still be unable to grant her the days off and left it at that without making any mention of Jane's threat to quit/retire.

Sandy then contacted her accountant, who also acted as her de facto business advisor, and explained what had happened with Jane. Also aware of Jane's previous shenanigans, Sandy's accountant told her that this was the out she had been looking for with Jane, and she had it all in writing. He told her that Jane had essentially resigned/retired and all Sandy needed to do was honour Jane's desire to do so, let her finish out her two weeks, or pay her two-weeks' wages in lieu with no further severance pay legally required since she hadn't been fired.

The following Monday, Sandy went into the office early accompanied by her longterm boyfriend to act as a witness. She put Jane's belongings from her desk into a box and took the things that were property of the business. Since Jane was old school and had resisted inputting client information in the computer database, this also included a small box filled with index cards which had client phone numbers, addresses, credit card information, and other personal information noted on them. In the meantime the other employee had arrived for work, and they all waited for Jane to show up.

Jane arrived just before 9:00 acting as though nothing had happened and greeted everyone with a ""good morning"" as she walked through the door. However, she was apparently taken slightly aback when she noticed Sandy's boyfriend seated in the far corner of the office. At this point, Jane was mid-way to her desk when Sandy informed her that there was no need to go any further and that she had accepted Jane's notification of retirement. She then handed Jane a cheque compensating her for the hours she had worked in the current pay period as well as two-weeks' wages in lieu of Jane finishing out her final two weeks before her ""retirement"".

Jane was dumbfounded and went into panic mode, ""But I didn't retire! I'm not ready to retire!"" 

Sandy responded that indeed she had retired, given her notice and had proof of it in writing. All Jane could do was continue repeating, ""But I didn't retire! I'm not ready to retire!"" while unsuccessfully attempting to get the support of the other employee who refused to come to her defence. Sandy then pointed to the box containing Jane's belongings, wished her a happy retirement, and told her to leave the office. Jane quickly rifled through the box and noticed that the small box containing the index cards with client informaiton was not there. She insisted that Sandy return it to her which Sandy refused to do explaining that it was property of the business, contained personal client information, and that she would be in violation of Canadian privacy laws if she were to let Jane take it. Jane's shock had now turned to obstinance and she refused to leave without the box. Both the other employee and Sandy's boyfriend had started to get involved, repeatedly telling Jane to just leave.

Sandy then informed Jane that if she didn't leave, they would have to call the RCMP (Canadian police), at which point, Sandy's boyfriend dialled 911 to inform the dispatcher of a disgruntled former employee at XYZ Travel Agency who was refusing to leave the premises. Within a few minutes, two police officers arrived, and Jane immediately ran to the door ranting about being fired and about the missing box of client info. In order to deescalate the situation, one police officer told Jane to come outside and explain to him her side of the story. The other officer remained in the office to hear Sandy's side of the story agreeing that Jane was not legally entitled to the box of client info. The other officer then reentered the business and told Jane to wait outside. He said that Jane was insisting that Sandy was holding onto her personal belongings, namely a box of important information. Both Sandy and the officer who had spoken to her explained the contents of the box to the other officer who in turn agreed it was not Jane's property. The police officers then picked up the larger box of Jane's personal belongings, took it outside to Jane, and told her she needed to go home.

To rub salt in Jane's wounds, the next day, Sandy put up a large sign in the window of the business congratulating Jane on her retirement and even put a small announcement in the local newspaper doing the same thing. The icing on the piece of revenge cake was Sandy, when filling out the necessary government forms for when an employee quits / gets fired / retires, made sure to check the box labelled ""retired"" for the reason for Jane no longer being employed. By doing so, Jane was ineligible to collect unemployment insurance benefits."

TIFU by Pavlov conditioning myself to get a boner every time I see the ocean,tifu,5631,x4z6wz,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/x4z6wz/tifu_by_pavlov_conditioning_myself_to_get_a_boner/,238,1662224239.0,"I(22M) have had a crippling fear of the ocean since I was a kid, the fact that I live on an island doesn't help that at all, with the years the fear only got worse, so at the beginning of the pandemic I had a great idea. Since I would not be going to the beach for a long time I started my master plan, every time I have sex or masturbated I would put ocean sounds in the background, so the memory of the situation would overpower the fear of the ocean, and it seemed like a great idea, so I did it, every time, no skips for the last 2 years. 

So yesterday I put that to the test, after 2 years of doing this it was time to see if the experiment had any results, some friends were going to play volleyball at the beach and I decided to go with them, but the moment I got out of the car, and heard the sound of the waves it was my end, rock hard, instantly, no questions, everyone was getting out of the car, and I was just stunned, just stood there, reflecting on every decision I ever made, every wave crash was like a punch in my balls, every seagull sound a shock through my whole body, I tried to stay in the car, but my friends started to mock me, so I put on 2 extra shorts and just sat there watching my friends play while I was trying to pray for any higher being, align my chakras, hypnosis, anything to make the monster sleep, but nothing worked, and worse, the fear was still there, everytime I looked at the ocean, my stomach would sink, and my phallus would get harder, it was hell, the dichotomy of the human existence every 30 seconds. So I got back to the car with them, everybody asked why I didn't play, didn't go in the water, and I couldn't get myself to explain to them that on top of my fear of the ocean, I Pavlov conditioned myself to have the biggest boner imaginable just by listening to the sound of waves. 

TL;DR: started having sex listening to ocean sounds to drown my fear of the ocean and ended up Pavlov conditioning me to get a boner every time I listen to waves"
Maliciously complied when cleaning the fridge for grandma,MaliciousCompliance,5896,x4yfb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/x4yfb6/maliciously_complied_when_cleaning_the_fridge_for/,261,1662222253.0,"My grandma is a hoarder. She honestly keeps a wide mix of things she can never throw out, has not been through in years, and has no interest in going through any of it to get rid of anything. This also applies to food and there‚Äôs no acknowledgement that normal people‚Äôs houses don‚Äôt look like that. I say this not to embarrass my grandma or anyone else who hoards, it just sets up my story. 

For the most part hoard was not that bad. I was able to walk down most hallways. I lived with her to care for her some since she was over 80 and the chances of her breaking a hip or going unnoticed under a pile of hoard was possible for her as it is for many of her age. I was used to not being able to throw anything out, the packages that came out of catalogs went directly into her room, occasionally I‚Äôd find something new in the 1/4 of a bedroom I got to keep but not often. The inside fridge, which she used, was full of expired things she wouldn‚Äôt throw away. I often used the garage fridge since it was emptier. 

One day I got my favorite command from her: clean the fridge. I got it through text so neither of us can pretend she didn‚Äôt ask me to clean the fridge. Since this is my ‚Äúdeserves her own season of American horror story without the hoarding‚Äù grandma she meant I needed to toss the one thing of mine she uncovered in the hoard she didn‚Äôt want there. Knowing full well I couldn‚Äôt get any backlash from an aunt for following the vague instructions I‚Äôd actually gotten I spent the next 2 hours filling 4 separate 13 gallon trash bags out to the trash, tossing it all out, and actually cleaning the fridge. 

This was one of a few reasons I was inevitably kicked out (I also made her comply with doctors orders as her caregiver, the absolute horror that is) but this was a great day for me."

"Let's reflect on WHY has the negative feedback been so overwhelming. There have been big underlying issues left unattended for years, and they caused the core of the game to slowly rot. When GGG needed to lean on it, it all collapsed like a house of cards.",pathofexile,6689,x4u7np,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/x4u7np/lets_reflect_on_why_has_the_negative_feedback/,881,1662210980.0,"This league needs to be a big wake-up call for GGG. For years, the community has been urging GGG to take a break from the crazy 3 month schedule, and tend to the core of the game. They refused again and again, instead relying on bandaid solutions that don't fix the underlying problems. Now, GGG tried to push in some of their reworks in preparation for PoE2, but it turned out that the core of the game cannot take it anymore, and it all imploded.

To recap the big issues plaguing the game:

1. Skill balance has been in awful place for years. Pushing ""archetypes"" started a ridiculous skill power creep, which went on for years. Small buffs here and there to the old skills were nowhere near big enough to keep up. The bandaid solution was creating ""meta"" skill by overbuffing, then overnerfing them to keep it fresh, never adressing the actual issue.

2. Crafting is extremly top heavy, with most regular players being gated from making anything good, without insane grinding for currency, to afford maybe one crafting project in a league. Harvest has been the bandaid solution for this, being completly overpowered compared to any other crafting method in the base game (and multiplying off of them as well), but it was never a proper longterm solution. Crafting requiring a PHD worth of knowledge, and fulltime job worth of grinding for currency, means that almost nobody can interact with it meaningfully, but the game difficulty is being balanced as if everybody does.

3. Unique balance is completly screwed, mostly because of the crafting power creep, which needed to be accompanied with frequent unique buffs, but it wasn't. Unique weapons are the biggest example of this. A proper balance of power between unique and crafted gear needs to exist, but hasn't for years now. The bandaid was releasing new, completly and utterly broken uniques, like Omniscience, Mageblood, Squire, which left 99% of the others in the dust. Ignoring this issue for so long, then buffing a couple of old uniques is doing maybe 1/20th of the work that needs to be done to get the unique/craft/rare balance in a good place.

4. Rare Gear off the ground has been pointless for many years. GGG somehow keeps saying how finding good rare pieces on the ground is their goal, yet their actions have consistently been making this issue worse. Metamodding was the first step away, followed by influenced gear, special undroppable affixes from essences, fossils, etc. Alongside those, rare dropped gear needed to improve, but it never did. It's so far behind the curve now, it basically needs a complete rework.

5. Monster power is out of this world. Staying in the same place for a split second is guaranteed death, the only good defense is blowing up everything instantly before it blows up you. Making a ""tanky"" character that can go toe to toe with enemies is impossible without ridiculous investment. And that has also been the bandaid fix here, that at certain gear level, it was fine. You would be blowing up whole screens before they attacked, or could make unkillable god characters. It was getting worse for years, to the point that you're either struggling to clear maps in 6 portals, or effordlessly cleaving through everything, no in-between. And even then, you can still instantly die if you make one misstep or stop paying attention for a second, or just simply overlook a hardly visible oneshot mechanic, which doesn't even require the monster that used it to be alive.

6. Trade. Not much really needs to be said here, I don't know anybody who does a good amount of trading and doesn't consider it to be a huge pain in the ass. Riddled with afk sellers, pricefixers, scammers, and generally just a bad time and a strain on gameplay. The bandaid was that getting all your gear and currencies yourself has been made quite easy, to the point that SSF players had no issues sustaining anything, and could make great gear all by themselves. With the massive reduction in loot and crafting potential, this is perhaps the most ""unfun"" of any of the issues currently in the game. You are forced to trade to do anything outside of basic crafting or playing a few meta skills, trade is awful, ssf is bricked. SSF has been exploding in popularity over the years due to the state of trading, but the only real longterm solution here is a proper working trade system that is not aids to interact with.

7. The elephant in the room, Archnemesis. For the entirity of the development since the launch of the game, nothing has been designed with Archnemesis in mind. Then it was forcefully inserted in, and it broke everything. The community has correctly told GGG that it will not work in the base game, GGG assured everybody that they ""extensively tested"" it and it's good, and it was (and is) a disaster. It makes all the issues in the game worse, and, most importantly, blantantly obvious. On top of that, since with how it interacts with league monsters, a completly untested loot drop rework was pushed into the game, the straw that broke the camel's neck.


At this point, a simple ""league off"" is nowhere near enough anymore. Fundamental reworks are required to multiple core systems. There is an opinion going around that GGG ""killed the game"" with this league, but the truth is, the game has been slowly dying inside for years, being prompted up like a mannequin by unsustainable power creep. Archnemesis just fastened the collapse. That's why we find ourselves in this overwhelming wave of negativity, which to GGG likely seems unreasonable for just a few unpopular changes. They don't grasp the severity of the situation. Either they finally wake up, or the game will slowly fade away, after the influx of players with PoE2 doesn't stick around, because the game, frankly, just isn't much fun to play longterm now."

I sent her a video of some tattoos that looked really cool, after I sent her that video she said ""you need my name and a picture of me"" I said that those are the worst tattoos to get. 
I then was dumb enough to say if anything I would get a tattoo of rem (my favorite anime character) and she got super jealous and upset because I mentioned that I would do that because it felt like I would rather be with a fictional character than her. 
I don't really know what to say to her at this point and I feel really bad because I like her a lot but it's not something that I feel like would be a good idea especially this early in our relationship.
If anyone has any input it would be appreciated!

Watching my parents eat: a lesson in how things add up,loseit,1074,x54fca,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/x54fca/watching_my_parents_eat_a_lesson_in_how_things/,88,1662238140.0,"So my parents are staying with me, on a visit for a few days. Both of them are(were?) attempting to lose weight as they‚Äôre both in the obese category. I‚Äôm also losing weight and have managed to enter the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù category recently.

Just to be clear: I don‚Äôt offer them opinions or recommendations unless they ask.

Anyway so I‚Äôve been watching what they eat because, of course, we share all meals now that they‚Äôre here. And it‚Äôs very interesting to me how a) things add up and b) how I myself used to eat/think.

Example: for breakfast they shared a container of sliced fruit, and each had a croissant with salami and cheese slices in it. I ate a Turkey breast sandwich. They had orange juice, coffee with cream/sugar and I had water and black coffee with a sweetener.

Why I‚Äôm comparing: before I started losing weight, I would have looked at this and said that we all ate the same thing. Bread, deli meat, coffee, fruit. But if you count the calories, they each had hundred more calories than I did. Old me would never have understood what she was ‚Äúdoing wrong‚Äù because she was ‚Äúeating the same as everyone else‚Äù. 

But here‚Äôs the thing, two people can go to Subway and one can order a grilled chicken sandwich, no cheese, all veggies and yellow mustard for less than 400kcal. And another can eat 700kcal by adding cheese, multiple sauces, meatballs, etc. these two sandwiches are not the same.

Another example: we went to the beach for several hours. They both drank MULTIPLE sodas each, while I had water the whole time. Old me would have thought we both ‚Äúate the same‚Äù because soda isn‚Äôt food.

At the end of each day, my parents are consuming several hundred calories more than I am, and they complain that they don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôre not losing weight. Old me would have complained too.

And the kicker for me is that, spending a full day at the beach brings me the same amount of joy whether or not I‚Äôm drinking soda. Eating a 400kcal subway sandwich is just as delicious to me as a 700kcal one. My breakfast was as delicious as a croissant. All these small changes ADD UP and they bring ZERO value/happiness to my life. It‚Äôs amazing to realize that I can make small tweaks and change so much about myself."

$ 1.66 Chicken Katsu w Fried Rice meal prep - 22 servings,EatCheapAndHealthy,415,x5aqju,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/x5aqju,16,1662255923.0,"Decided to make something a little more calorie heavy this time, but still within my diet goals. Turned out really well! 
I meal prep because it is cost efficient for me and makes it easier to stay on track with my fitness and diet goals. 

**Storage**
Immediately freeze anything you won‚Äôt eat after 4 days. I‚Äôm eating 2 a day.
My containers are from tjmaxx. While the clear ones are target brand ones. 

**reheating**
Sometimes I don‚Äôt mind eating it cold. Still good to me. When I do reheat this I will air fry the chicken. 

**22 servings**
 - 582 calories
 - 45g protein

**Ingredients:**
- 7.7 lb chicken breast or thigh 
- 15 cups of day old rice
- green onions
- onions
- 5 carrots
- 2 cucumbers
- 2 boxes of panko 
- salt, pepper, seasonings of choice
- almond milk
- apple cider vinegar
- flour 
- sesame oil
- soy sauce
- peanut oil
- 12 eggs

**Recipe**

**Katsu**
1. Butterfly your chicken if it is breast 
2. Tenderize your chicken 
3. Salt your chicken and keep in fridge for 1 hour (optional)
4. Set up your breading station
5. Put seasonings of choice inside panko  bowl
6. Dip in flour
7. Dip in almond milk mix 
8. Dip in panko mix
9. Repeat 6-8 
10. Heat peanut oil on pan 
11. Once hot, start frying chicken on medium until fully cooked.
12. Alternatively you can cook the outside/breading in the pan and cook the chicken into an oven preheated on 200 F
13. Cut chicken in strips

**buttermilk mix**
For the breading I mixed 2 cups of unsweetened ROOM TEMP almond milk with 2.5 tbsp of apple cider vinegar and let sit for a few minutes. 

**Fried Rice**
1. Scramble 7 eggs into little pieces and set aside.
2. Whisk 5 eggs and mix with rice.  
3.  Saut√© your onions and garlic then cook your carrots 
4. Pour rice mixture in heated wok and stir fry until rice starts separating.
5. Season as needed, I use salt and pepper with a tiny bit of soy sauce and sesame oil as I‚Äôm trying to make this light. Throw in your green onions as well. 
6. When finished, turn off heat and mix in cucumbers. You don‚Äôt want to cook these with the carrots because it will excrete a lot of moisture and become bitter in the fridge."

Blue Shield Insurance is hoodwinking Bay Area businesses and residents by pretending to have an entire network of clinicians that they don't actually have.,bayarea,808,x55n5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/x55n5f/blue_shield_insurance_is_hoodwinking_bay_area/,89,1662241326.0,"Been dealing with a rough patch and trying to find a therapist in the Bay Area. I turned to my health insurance, as one should, to find a provider in my network.

After phonecall after phonecall after phonecall it became clear to me rather quickly that Blue Shield CA's provider network is a fiction. And not just a little fiction, but a total fiction.

Addresses are old, therapists are no longer practicing, or accepting new patients. Or are even part of the network. In one case I was told all of the providers listed with a particular group were not in the Blue Shield network. (About six people).

I thought I was having bad luck until I read about [ghost networks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/02/19/mental-health-ghost-network/).

It appears Blue Shield CA doesn't offer a network of practitioners, but nonetheless claim that they do by neglecting or padding their list. I'm considering contacting the CA Attorney General's office about this.

Anyway fair warning for anybody looking for a head shrinker. If you get insurance through your work, go to HR and see if you can switch to a different provider if you need therapy and have Blue Shield CA.

\--

Edit: It's become very clear to me this is a huge problem for many people and the state has levied some penalties in the past. The correct agency is the DMHC and [they have a complaint form](https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/FileaComplaint.aspx). Unless there is an immediate threat to your health, you need to first however [file a grievance with your provider](https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/File-a-Complaint/Contact-Your-Health-Plan.aspx). I am taking this step right now. (If there's an immediate threat, contact DMHC)

If you have not been able to get access to a provider because BlueShield is playing games with their provider list, go here: [https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/](https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/)"

"Opinion: The writing is on the wall, PoE is going down the same path that killed the player base of WoW. The players vs devs attitude has been the downfall of many games.",pathofexile,1228,x55x0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/x55x0b/opinion_the_writing_is_on_the_wall_poe_is_going/,359,1662242088.0,"Despite all of the valid and well worded criticisms GGG has gotten about both recent changes and changes in older leagues, all of GGG's messages have had a central theme of ""fun isn't allowed unless you do it our way"" and worse ""you can't have too much fun so we have to intentionally introduce artificial challenges/limits to make it annoying to have fun"". This is incredibly arrogant and make no mistake it will kill the game, it's just a matter of time.

WoW was a great example of this, the changes introduced to the game in the last few expansions especially felt way more geared to working against and limiting what the player is allowed to do than making sure the player has fun. Some great examples of this for anyone who knows what I'm talking about: Complete class redesigns between WoD and Legion that left many classes or specs not fun to play or not viable, completely RNG legendaries in Legion that would decide if you're able to play your spec or not (with some people never being able to get the legendaries they needed the entire expac), GCD changes from Legion to BFA that slowed gameplay a ridiculous amount all for niche purposes that did not translate to the rest of the game, the disaster that was raids not being thoroughly tested in BFA, and lets not forget about factions and how arbitrary it was to prevent players across factions from playing with each other for almost 20 years. These are just to name a few from the recent expansions and every time there would be criticism about these systems, devs would double down and dismiss feedback. Make no mistake, the WoW player base didn't dive off a cliff last year just because of the scandals that were revealed at Blizzard, but it was the attitude the devs had towards the players for years where all criticism was seen as toxicity towards the devs. The scandals were just the drop that broke the dam, they emphasized that the company wasn't worth defending for a lot of people which released the flood of bottled up anger and resentment. Way before any of the scandals broke the general sentiment in the game (especially BFA and shadowlands) was that it wasn't fun to play most content outside of raiding which was basically just propped up by the socialization aspect, and even worse most people didn't feel like the gameplay of their classes were even fun anymore. This just ended up with entire guilds being dead except for raid time where everyone would log in and then immediately log off after until the guild just disbands because its not fun enough to log on anymore. The main hubs during BFA and Shadowlands showed this, they were practically ghost towns compared to the immediately previous expansions.

The latest messaging about harvest crafts are pretty telling of these themes. They balanced harvest crafts this league around a trade system that they don't even fully support in the game, most of it is handled via third party markets that aren't part of the game itself. Further, the reasoning is weak at best. It feels like the game is being balanced around the people who will spend all of their time playing the markets instead of actually enjoying the game itself. I would love to hear how SSF is going for anyone who's actually playing it. In reality, whats the worst thing that would happen if harvest crafts were tradable as they were, a high end player making an incredibly juiced build? Is that such a bad thing? I'd imagine that most players do not care about how that high end player plays the game or even what the markets are like, most players are just wanting to blast some monsters and make some meaningful end game progression, either with a meta build that they looked up or their own build that they've spent some time putting together, but now they can't do that because the game is not balanced around the average player but around the high end player making juiced builds.

Sorry the biggest paragraph here is about WoW, but there are many parallels between how WoW took player feedback and how PoE is taking player feedback and the direction it caused the games to go. This game is being balanced as if it's a super competitive game and that is just not the case. This game might be competitive for a very very small portion of the players, but most players are looking to jump in, try an old or new build, play with the league mechanic, and blast some monsters in their free time after work or school or anything else in life that's more important than PoE and GGG is actively working against those players because it doesn't align with their ""vision""."

Basically when I was 13, I didn't have access to real porn, I had no internet or anything so I had to masturbate to either Viagra ads (with the women in the bikinis) or else my own drawn pictures of women in bikinis which were horrible. Also I used to kinda get a hardon when I watched people die in movies, when I was 7 or 8 I avoided war movies because they gave me a stiffy, I don't really know why. So hot chick + death = super hot, at least for me back then cause I was just starting to sexually awaken. So I fast-forwarded to her walking through the fungus trees and suddenly she gets shot and you can see her ass jiggling when she hit the ground and I would rub my penis with my hand playing that scene on repeat. Then I fucked up my DVD player by messing up A-B repeat then pulling the power which made it fuck up somehow, I don't remember I just remember panicking thinking I broke it. But anyway I used to get a huge hard-on watching her die over and over and watching her ass jiggle a bit when she hit the ground, the problem is that the camera then pans backward up toward the sky and a leaf covers her body pretty quickly so you don't get to see much, cause they keep shooting her after she dies and her ass keeps jiggling as they mutilate her corpse with their laser guns, but that stupid fucking leaf gets in the way. I remember getting so goddamn pissed at that leaf. I'd be about to cum and it'd get in the way and fucking ruin everything.Ôªø"

I've watched every back episode UTS, B2B and Money Pit (a couple times now). I freaking love that content. I was hoping the Recurrent buyout wouldn't be noticeable, I was wrong....DEAD WRONG.

They put some of the drill footage behind the DU pay wall, which wasn't amazing content but the idea of paying for the balance of a donut video is a new thing and it truly makes me sad for the channels direction. How many times can you make a shitty video about how much cars cost? We get it, they're expensive nowadays. Especially for normal people without a YT channel or corporate sponsors like, I don't know, Raycon or Keeps or manscaped. 

Where's Jobe been? How bout less ugly ass shirts? Maybe some actual mechanical work or a deep dive into some interesting car content. If you have 'tiktok' or  'hack' in any of your last couple video titles, odds are your either out of good ideas, or its too late to be salvaged anyway. 

Here's to hoping for the old donut back one day."

It's a long flight, I was pissed, but I try to be extra courteous to the people in the seats on either side of me because it is uncomfortable. (Usually I opt for a window or aisle seat, but because of a snafu that still hasn't been ironed out, my visas were disapproved sometime after I flew out of the USA and landed in Tokyo... but that's another story.)

I was one of the last on the plane and worked my way to the back and found my seat, seven rows from the back, in the center seat, a lovely woman from Atlanta on my left and a grumpy old shit from hell on my right. It's a good thing I'm slender because my row mates were rather robust in stature and it would be elbow to elbow.

The woman got up and let me in and the gentleman by the window looked at me and said ""Shit. It's already too crowded."" And then turned toward the window and grumbled to himself. I got into my seat and noticed his shoes were where my feet should be. I asked if they were his, noticing that the woman still had hers on. He said they were and turned back to the window. 

""Um, could I get you to move them so I can get comfortable?"" I didn't want to touch someone else's property, let alone their shoes because ... well ... ewww.

His rotund girth couldn't reach them, so the lady got up so I could move out of his way. He grunted and he fished them out. He slid them under my seat and I said I was going to put mine there and he bent down again and finally moved them under his seat, grumbling something incoherent, but nothing complimentary, and staring darts at me.

I finally sat down and had to ask him to pull my seatbelt from under his backside. He said the ""fuck' word several times I believe.

It wasn't very comfortable, but I am former military and 2x divorced, and can put up with being uncomfortable for very long periods of time.

We're in the air and he keeps knocking my elbow off the armrest. We get food and he bumps me when I drink, making it look almost accidental. I turn my air on because of the odor and he turns his on and forces it as best he can toward me. (No, I know I am smelling clean)

I close my eyes after the meal and he keeps opening and closing the damn window shade. It annoys the shit out of everyone in the area. He keeps ""adjusting"" himself in his seat, bumping into me, keeping me from sleeping. It was a continuous 12 and a half hours of him being as discourteous as he could without crossing a line where I say something or begin retaliation, like farting loudly as I bend and stretch my back.

The woman and I, she a grandmother to seven and me expecting my first grandson late this month, had a number of friendly conversations and I wished her the best as the plane began de-boarding.

The man on the other hand, since he was by the window, had to wait for me to get out of the row to get his case. I, on the other hand, was not in a hurry. I had a seven hour layover and had plenty of time. I allowed the six other rows behind me to get off the plane before me, saying I had to get my backpack from the overhead. 

The jerk in the window seat said not to me ""Come on, all fucking ready,"" in a stage whisper and I know I didn't hear him. I just kept smiling and letting the back of the plane unload. When they were all out, a guy who had seen my backpack grabbed it for me as he was getting his carry on. Maybe he'd seen what asshat had done for 12 hours. I was able to be the second to the last off the plane. 

He ended up being one of the very last getting off the plane. I almost hit him with my backpack as I swung it on my back. He pushed by me, disgruntled, once we got on the jetway. He was grumbling about being late. He was already huffing and all I could do was think ""It must be tough being a jackass all the time.""

tl;dr

Guy was a jerk for 12 hours. I made his last few minutes uncomfortable."

From a death doula to an oncological psychologist; an embalmer to a Medium who can contact the other side, a death ritual historian to a Doctor who studies Near Death Experiences, I‚Äôve covered nearly every facet of dying, death and beyond and collected these interviews in a series called [Death, Grief &amp; Other Sh*t We Don‚Äôt Discuss](https://www.deathandgrief.show/follow/)

I‚Äôve learned a lot about loss and my goal is to share what I‚Äôve learned for others in this club, that we don‚Äôt want to be in, but all of us will end up in.

Proof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/a/Ktw2FZA)!

EDIT: I have an editing session in a few minutes, but I'm happy to answer additional questions when I get back this evening!  In the meantime, thank you so m much for all of your questions so far! These have been so great & really thought provoking and I appreciate it. I think  some of the conversations we've had here so far can really be a help to others <3

I (27f) just discovered a ring box in my boyfriend's (29m) nightstand and I think he's planning on proposing to  me. I'm thinking of just dumping him.

This all began 3 years ago when me and my boyfriend became intimate for the first time. We were fooling around and when he finished he did the Mickey Mouse laugh. At first I thought I misheard him or that it was  some sort of joke so I didn't bother mentioning it.

For the next few times he didn't do anything so I thought it was a one time thing but then I made the mistake of suggesting to spice things up in  the bedroom. He only talks to me in the mickey mouse voice during sex.

He moans in a Mickey voice. He calls me princess in a Mickey voice and I  don't think I can take it anymore. Our bedroom time has always been  limited as we both work very demanding jobs and our libido isn't  specifically high so I thought I could just overlook this aspect of our  relationship since he is overall a great guy in all other aspects.

Now that I found the engagement ring in his nightstand I think I'm gonna call it quits. I don't think I can take the Mickey voice for the rest of my life."

The lost sector system just plain sucks right now. It would suck even if they dropped exotics even at a 1:1 completion to drop ratio. Nevermind that, you can grind 5-10 sectors without seeing one drop at times. 

Half the exotics in the game are neglected and suck; they just end of becoming time abusing fluff loot. The pool is too large, the stats are too RNG, and the drop rate is too RNG. You seriously expect us to grind 100s of these things, weekly to have a CHANCE to get a roll we want? That's sort of sadistic. 

Make the lost sector drop glass needles, or just some currency that lets us reroll a specific piece we want. Hell, if you wanna time-gate the glass needle slot I would even be okay with that. Today is boots needles, tomorrow is chest needles, etc.

That being said the most environmentaly friendly thing you can do is just keep your vehicle until it either dies or takes too much to repair. 

The amount of resources it takes to make a new car is insane. We all went a better world but trading in a perfectly good car to buy a new electric car isn't helping the environment"

Yet she is a clear-eyed adult recounting these horrors and the extent of her healing is evident from the degree to which she is able to articulate her story now. Not to mention how she can turn moments of pain into hilarious turns of phrase that I laughed at with guilt and shame. 

It's most definitely not an easy read, and anyone with a history of eating disorders or abusive trauma should tread carefully, but it is absolutely worth adding to your reading list."

The real reason Walt broke bad was because of that terrible handjob,breakingbad,1020,x553eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/x553eh/the_real_reason_walt_broke_bad_was_because_of/,71,1662239892.0," I'm telling you, the real reason Walter broke bad was because he received the world's shittiest handjob which made him reconsider his entire existence. Your wife yanking around your 50 year old half chub with 10% of her attention while simultaneously borderline orgasming at selling a girthy 8,5 inch vase on eBay for 56 dollars is an experience that people in the darkest bdsm dungeons would be shivering at. I swear to god Walter Jr. is probably having a wilder sex life on the other side of the wall with his sock than these two have had in the past five years.

So when he received his cancer diagnosis the prolonged silence was not due to shock but because of pure bliss and relief because he knew that in a few years he'll likely be dead and won't have to live like that.

That's why when he received the news of remission he was so goddamn angry. And I don't know why people see the Salamanca twins as villains, they were clearly just tryna help a homie out and spare him from this existence. Oh, but why did they go after Hank then, you might ask? Well, then you clearly don't remember Hank's handjob scene from season 4, they were trying to save him from that. Really they were the true heroes of this show trying to save people from fucking miserable, dick shriveling handjobs.

And then, of course, shit starts happening, Skyler fucks Ted and Walt goes off the chain prolly thinking stuff like ""bet she didn't give just a shitty handjob to Ted, oh no! My god, I wouldn't even be surprised if she agreed to do anal with him! While I've been pleading for years!"". That right there's a thought progression enough to start a man crashing plants in random office buildings. And the way it can mess with your sexual thinking, Lord only knows what kind of cataclysmic insanities Walt was busting nuts to while living alone.

But then Walt has a romantic dinner with Gus, realises there's at least someone who'd probably agree to have anal with him, meanwhile Ted gets paralyzed, no more anal for him, Walt calls up Skyler ""I won"".

Now Walt can be smug for the entirety of season 5, he's back on top of the sex chain. So Breaking Bad is really about Walt's sexual transformation from a submissive forced-into-humiliation-kink middle aged man to a borderline sex offender to an off the rails cuck to a pure alpha male who's ascended past sex and at the end of season 5 we can see him die with bliss on his face because he's redeemed himself."

I was a calibration technician and my job along with the 2 others we had was to keep our tools and robots in the plant in line with our customers specs. Failure to do so would allow our customers to pull out of their contracts with no legal ramifications. So an important job.

However the rest of the plant didn't think so and neither did my supervisor who the company hired off the street with literally no Knowledge of the job at all. (Story for another day there.

 Anyways we were behind on calibrations big time. This was due mostly to thr fact that the lines refused to give us the tools to calibrate them because they didn't wanna affect production and my so-called supervisor had no spine and kept telling us to work around it. For reference we kept 6000 different tools and robots calibrated and almost 3000 in the system were overdue, so yea we were in trouble and it was a ticking time bomb. 

One of our customers had called and said the next Monday they were coming in for an inspection, which you think would be a big ol ""o shit"" moment but no one seemed to care. I volunteered to work that weekend to get everything on that customers line calibrated so we could avoid the shit storm, but my boss told me that he couldn't approve any overtime without a detailed list of what I planned to do. I told him I couldn't give him a list ahead of time as I had no clue which tools were where or what I would have to replace but I could log it all as I went and give it to him Monday. He said no it was either now or I wasn't allowed to show up. So I didn't. 

Next Monday customer comes in, within an hour of being there realizes almost all of their tools and robots are 4 months out of date. Immediately shutdowns production sends those employees home and pulls their contract because now they had to recall 4 months worth of product. They start slamming on my department to which i just looked at my boss, laughed and then quit, because fuck that. 

One of friends that work there after I left told me the customer renegotiated the contract much more in their favor meaning the company got paid waaay less than they were originally per product and the company took a loss on profits that year because apparently the customer went and told all of the other customers it could and a shit storm hit that place. They ended up selling the place after another year."

Most of the lads in this team endured losing the League by a single point before losing the CL by the slimmest margins. They put themselves through physical and mental exhaustion last season and are paying the price for it now. 


It's not their fault FSG haven't invested. 

They are still giving it their all and never giving up on a match. 

They need us now. 



By all means vent your frustration at the team, be pissed at decisions, poor decisions on the pitch or with subs, get angry at yhe board or Henry himself. 

But fuck me you need to get behind these players. We've had it fucking amazing over the last five years and been spoiled to be competing across so many fronts for so long. 


We need a new identity and to find form yes but with City drawing we are five points off them having played United and Everton and we are apparently in a crisis and they are having a dream start. 

We started slow last season and were 12 points off at Xmas. If you won't back the players when they need the fans, don't you dare fucking celebrate the wins."

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Slanek, Venlil Space Corps***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 8, 2136*

The humans instructed me to place a wraparound headset over my ears. I was impressed with how they had modified their technology with Venlil in mind, though I hoped I wasn‚Äôt the only one who would get to use it. The earpiece fed simulated audio of alarms and hits; it also allowed Sara to speak to me directly.

‚ÄúSlanek, I‚Äôm going to talk to you throughout this exercise. In time, I hope you will learn to do these things yourself,‚Äù she explained, in a melodic voice. ‚ÄúThoughts guide our actions. By changing your thoughts, you can unlearn negative behaviors.‚Äù

I tilted my head. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs the problem. You can‚Äôt control your thoughts.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, not with that attitude. You didn‚Äôt develop your thinking patterns overnight,‚Äù Sara responded. ‚ÄúIt takes time, effort, and understanding to make a self-adjustment. Mind if I ask you a few questions, before we begin the simulation?‚Äù

‚ÄúGo for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen was the first time you encountered a predator?‚Äù

I failed to see the relevance of the question, but I decided to humor the human. If she thought delving into the origins of predator phobia would further her understanding, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to play along. The more background info she had on me, the better subject I would be.

*You saw the Arxur on TV, but that doesn‚Äôt really count. Mother tried to shield us from those atrocities,* I recalled.

Encounters with predators were uncommon on Venlil Prime, though occasionally, one slipped through the cracks. Teams of investigators in armored vehicles would travel out to the site, scorching any area with evidence of a hunter‚Äôs presence. There was no way we would leave them alive to reproduce and terrorize our settlements. Extermination officer was an occupation that paid well, but all the money in the world wouldn‚Äôt be enticing enough for me.

‚ÄúMy parents took me for a walk in the local pasture, and there was a dead rodent on the sidewalk. Lots of blood. There were larvae all over it; news cameras turned up within minutes.‚Äù A shudder rippled down my spine at the memory. ‚ÄúThe anchors said a predator might be on the loose. The entire neighborhood was placed on a curfew by local police. Schools were closed indefinitely.‚Äù

Tyler couldn‚Äôt hear the other end of the conversation, but he shot me a baffled look. The human‚Äôs eyebrow arched up his forehead, as though he couldn‚Äôt believe what he was hearing. I think the words he mouthed were, *What the fuck?*

‚ÄúTell me more about that. Did they find out what happened to the dead animal?‚Äù Sara inquired.

I gritted my teeth. ‚ÄúIt died of natural causes, according to the autopsy. Everyone was relieved that there was no imminent threat. But that was the week I learned about food chains‚Ä¶and our place on it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did that make you feel?‚Äù

‚ÄúScared. Powerless. I just couldn‚Äôt believe there were animals that based their existence on k-killing.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can tell this is difficult for you, Slanek. If I may, what conclusions did your childhood self reach about predators?‚Äù

‚ÄúPredators had to be cruel and unfeeling, to be able to stomach such violence. To *eat* that rotting corpse I saw.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Arxur must have cemented those beliefs. I take it that was your initial feeling toward humans?‚Äù

A horrified gasp came from my chest, as I realized what I just said about predators. It had slipped my mind that I was talking to one, while I was focusing on the emotional residue of that experience. There was the thoughtlessness Marcel teased me over.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, that was too honest. I didn‚Äôt mean to say you‚Äôre‚Äî‚Äù I squeaked.

‚ÄúRelax. I‚Äôm not offended.‚Äù Sara‚Äôs voice was reserved and soothing, like the rustle of leaves in the wind. ‚ÄúI want you to be transparent with me; especially about how humans make you feel.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to think about humans being predators. It‚Äôs jarring to equate you with, uh‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThe animal in the field. With eating ‚Äòrotting corpses.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

The scientist was silent on the other end of the headset, and I caught some light scraping sounds. She must be taking notes from what I was telling her. I hoped I hadn‚Äôt said too much; the humans wouldn‚Äôt admit they were offended, even if they were.

‚ÄúYou did great, Slanek. Thank you for sharing that with me. What I am going to ask of you now, is to try to put yourself in the predator‚Äôs shoes,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúCome up with as many reasons why an animal might choose to hunt as you can: beyond being cruel, violent, and unfeeling. We‚Äôll talk about it at tomorrow‚Äôs session.‚Äù

I focused my eyes on the floor, ignoring Tyler‚Äôs inquisitive stare. Did flesh taste so good that it was addictive? It was tough to think of a single other allure to predation, other than biological impulse.

Even with humans, I assumed they had those aspects within them due to their brutal hunting methods. The difference was that I believed they had another side, and that there were enough positive attributes to outweigh the repugnant ones. Besides, they found a way to sate their cravings without harming other creatures.

*Maybe that‚Äôs something I should ask Marcel. He might know the answers Sara is looking for.*

I breathed a weary sigh. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can do that, but I‚Äôll try.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Now, we‚Äôre going to start your mission. The goal of this exercise is to stop any hostile ships from reaching orbital range of Earth. I‚Äôll be here for guidance as needed.‚Äù

The screens glowed to life, and Tyler clenched his fist around the firing trigger. The image of Earth in the background was hyperrealistic, down to the orange glow dotting the continents. Swirling clouds idled across the oceans, and the inky backdrop framed the planet in serene radiance. It was a breathtaking sight, even in a simulation.

I searched for enemy contacts on sensor data. Craning my neck, I tried to get a visual on a fast-approaching vessel from our left. The blinders were inhibiting my sight line, so it was difficult to ground myself. At least it rendered me impervious to the virtual explosions and conflict taking place in the distance.

My breath hitched in my throat, as a plasma beam sailed meters from our hull. This felt too real and dangerous. The stress of decision-making was enough to make panic seep in. I was frozen as usual; what was I supposed to do? I couldn‚Äôt even remember how to engage the targeting systems.

Nonetheless, inaction was unacceptable. My trembling paw slammed the steering column and veered the ship toward the hostile. My diminished vision blurred; my heart was pounding so hard that it felt like an earthquake in my chest. Every instinct declared that facing an aggressive foe was too perilous.

*I feel like I‚Äôm going to die. Like I‚Äôm flying into my doom‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs not even real.*

Meanwhile, Tyler was impossibly collected, as he aligned kinetic munitions with the target. How could humans push through the chemical fog with such ease? It was as though their instincts compelled them to run headlong toward danger, rather than gallop to safety.

‚ÄúSlanek, deep breaths. Count to five as you inhale, then count to five as you exhale,‚Äù Sara‚Äôs voice growled.

I took a few wheezing breaths, attempting to comply with her orders. Through the lightheadedness, I could see the opposing craft enlarging in the viewport. A horrified gasp escaped before I could contain it; this was all happening so quickly. There was no time to think.

Everything on screen froze, including the hostile that was just magnified. I slumped my shoulders in shame; the humans were going to can the experiment on day one. I was a hopeless cause. Helping them was never going to be within my capability, no matter how much I wanted it to be.

‚ÄúTalk to me!‚Äù The scientist‚Äôs voice sounded urgent over the headset, which jolted me out of my daze. ‚ÄúRate your fear on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst you‚Äôve ever felt.‚Äù

I blinked in confusion. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶7?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can work with that. Everything is going to be fine. This feeling will pass,‚Äù Sara said. ‚ÄúWhat thoughts went through your mind, as you started to feel afraid?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I know I can‚Äôt do this. I‚Äôm not a fighter, and I never will be. My instincts can‚Äôt handle stress or danger.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm hearing is that you don‚Äôt feel that you can control your emotions. You‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs not possible already.‚Äù

‚ÄúHumans are special. I have to face what I am.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you are is a good pilot. Remember, the enemy is just as vulnerable as you.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt d-doesn‚Äôt feel that way. Never does.‚Äù

‚ÄúFocus on your target and get the shot off. Everything else doesn‚Äôt matter; you can complete that one thing. One step at a time.‚Äù

Squeezing my eyes shut, I allowed my breathing to fall back into a calm rhythm. It was within my power to press a few buttons, wasn‚Äôt it? There had to be a way to override my instincts, the way the humans kept their aggression in check. Marcel had squared off against nine Arxur vessels in an inferior ship, and we survived. This was nothing.

‚ÄúHey, we can do this, Slanek. You‚Äôre not alone here. Remember that!‚Äù Tyler growled.

I flicked my ears in appreciation. The sandy-haired human didn‚Äôt have much heart after learning Earth‚Äôs insurmountable odds, but he was still trying to be supportive. Bravery felt a little less difficult, knowing that fearless predators had my back. Humans were survivors, and that meant I was in good company.

*You‚Äôre not doing this by yourself. You‚Äôre on the predators‚Äô side; not the Krakotl. They‚Äôre the ones who should be afraid.*

I believed in humanity‚Äôs strength, even if I was uncertain of my own. Newfound determination swelled in my veins as the simulation resumed. The blinders were there for the purpose of directing my attention to a single task. It was a matter of just acting, and not thinking at all.

The opposing ship barreled toward us, racing closer to Earth. My aviation knowledge kicked in, and I verified the target on sensors. All I contemplated was the intake of my breathing, while my claw jammed down on the missile switch. Projectiles homed in on the sleek bomber, tracking its evasion attempts.

My human partner sent a flurry of kinetics close behind. It was prudent to take advantage of any disruption to shields. The missiles rocked the imaginary opponent, and Tyler‚Äôs well-timed rounds tore through its armor. The seamless teamwork was invigorating, for a moment. The predator bared his teeth at the thrill, and I almost mimicked him.

Instead of allowing the follow-up options to overwhelm me, I asked myself what humans would do. They would go for the kill, and not give the enemy any recovery time. Persistence hunting taught them how to be relentless; maybe I could learn from that cruelty as well.

‚ÄúLeave my friends alone!‚Äù I hissed to the screen. It was easy to channel my outrage at the unprovoked assault on Earth. ‚ÄúNobody hurts my herd, ever again.‚Äù

I navigated the ship nearer to our nemesis. My anger at injustice was warring with the voice that told me to turn back. The resolute snarl on Tyler‚Äôs face was enough to keep my paw on the accelerator. Just this once, I wanted to be the predator; to pounce on a weakened enemy.

My heart was racing, while I unloaded a devastating salvo into their flanks. Orange tendrils burst from its metallic shell, and damned the fictitious crew to the vacuum. The simulation faded back to white, with a ‚Äòmission success‚Äô declaration.

‚ÄúYou did it!!‚Äù Tyler cheered, forcing a grin. ‚ÄúThat was all you, Slanek.‚Äù

I leapt up from the pilot‚Äôs seat, wagging my tail. As the Federation often reminded us, Venlil weren‚Äôt supposed to have a fighting bone in our bodies. How had I managed to kill an enemy‚Ä¶and emulate Terran intensity? Had the humans changed me?

An answer to Sara‚Äôs earlier question popped into my mind. An animal might choose to be a predator, because it refined their species into something stronger. Hunting mandated discipline, and lessened the brunt of fearful instincts. Maybe it was empowering to be the one dealing the damage.

Sara cleared her throat. ‚ÄúI told you that you were a good pilot. That exercise should give you hope for what we can accomplish.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it was only one ship, guys,‚Äù I pointed out. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs nothing compared to the Krakotl invasion.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to increase the duration and number of enemies every day. You‚Äôll be taking on an army in no time.‚Äù

The exhilaration of success fizzled out, as I processed that daunting prospect. The scientist sounded hellbent on pushing me well past my instincts‚Äô limit, when all was said and done. Every day was going to be more of a struggle than the next. If nothing else though, her questioning had forced me to consider my fears in a new light.

‚ÄúOh buddy, I‚Äôm so proud of you.‚Äù Marcel must have snagged the microphone. His rumbling voice fluttered into my ears. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to turn those birds to space feathers. They‚Äôll never see it coming.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, uh, but‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know about that.‚Äù

He chuckled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre stronger than you think you are. The attacking skills are there, as we all saw. You nailed that fucker, even with Tyler button mashing and getting in your way.‚Äù

This time, the tall copilot leaned close enough to hear the headset chatter. He threw up his hands in exasperation, then turned his glare at me for giggling. There was hilarity in the expression that once would‚Äôve had me on the floor, begging not to be eaten. I knew humans well enough to recognize the difference between jest and malice.

Tyler waved a fist at the camera. ‚ÄúSlanek and I are gonna win this war, while you‚Äôre still on your ass eating Doritos.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, are you kidding, bro? I‚Äôll be up there, stopping you from snacking on too many crayons mid-battle.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat can I say? That‚Äôs a true predator‚Äôs diet.‚Äù

I appreciated that my friends were able to make light of a dark situation; that was their method of coping with the unpleasant. There wasn‚Äôt a more resilient species in the galaxy. With their example to model, maybe it was possible to mold me into something a little more vicious.

The survival of these alien predators was what was important, I reminded myself. My progression was a secondary objective that would complement Terran aims. If Earth was to be lost, the spiteful defenders would take as many enemies with them as possible. No battle waged against humans was ever as easy as it looked on paper.

Regardless, I had faith the Venlil Republic wouldn‚Äôt hang our allies out to dry.

She explained it like this ‚Äúpeople were really struggling to eat enough, a complete stranger would walk up the driveway begging for food and we would invite him in to feed him. We relied on our neighbors and we all helped each other out in one way or another and we got threw it‚Äù.

My grandparents were very poor catholic farmers back then as was most everyone else. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the doom and gloom of human nature in disaster environments. But we should never forget the importance of helping one another and the benefits of building and keeping solid relationships with your neighbors. Anyways just thought it was interesting in a positive light-take care everyone and have a good Labor Day my fellow Americans!"

A lot of things that don‚Äôt make sense to me or I simply can‚Äôt make sense of. I don‚Äôt exactly have a philosophical outlook on the universe; what our purpose is and all that, but what I saw that night left me asking questions I never thought I‚Äôd want to ask.

I‚Äôve seen a lot of things as an Uber driver ‚Äî questionable things, even. That‚Äôs just a part of the job description. It‚Äôs an interesting experience, to say the least. But hey, it puts food on the table.

I have two kids that I need to take care of and their father is no longer in the picture. I‚Äôm rarely ever home because I‚Äôm constantly working to make ends meet. I work as a teacher during the day and would drive for Uber as soon as the school day ended. I try to accept as many rides as I can, for as long as I can.

I wish I never accepted that last ride.

\-

It was around 10PM when I got the notification for a booking. The drop-off location struck me as odd, but I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time. It was quite a ways from the city and I didn‚Äôt think people even lived in that area. The fare was a considerably large amount, so I decided I could make this my last ride and get home a bit earlier than usual.

I was just by the pick-up location, so I was able to get there in under five minutes. A tall, slender woman settled herself in the back seat. She was gorgeous. Short brown hair, impossibly perfect bone structure, and the brightest green eyes I‚Äôd ever seen on a human being. She looked to be in her mid-twenties.

I greeted the woman as she entered the car. ‚ÄúGood evening. Lauren, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. And you, dear? Yasmin, yes?‚Äù She asked me in a tone that sounded far beyond her years.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour name, dear.‚Äù

My passengers rarely asked me for my name. They usually just got in and stared at their phones for the entire ride. I guess she was just trying to be nice and make conversation. ‚ÄúYes. Nice to meet you.‚Äù

‚ÄúLikewise, Yasmin,‚Äù she responded.

It was quiet for a few minutes as we drove to our destination. She spoke up again a few times and asked me about my life. What I did for a living, my family, my hobbies, etc. Then she asked me about my kids.

‚ÄúIs your husband watching them right now?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, no‚Ä¶ My cousin babysits them until I get home. She‚Äôs nocturnal, so she doesn‚Äôt mind the late nights.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow nice of her.‚Äù

I was starting to get a strange feeling about Lauren. It was odd to me that she was asking me about my kids in the way that she was. My passengers didn‚Äôt normally converse with me, and when they did, they would mostly talk about themselves. Then again, I could have just been overthinking.

That, or it was from the burrito I had that morning.

*Grumble.*

Definitely the burrito. As I started to feel more uncomfortable with my bowel situation, I checked the map to see if there were any gas stations near the drop-off location. I couldn‚Äôt find any, which was unsurprising. There was no way I could hold it until I got back to the city.

*Grumble.*

As much as Lauren creeped me out, I couldn‚Äôt just shit my pants. So I mustered up all my courage and asked her, ‚ÄúUh, Lauren? This might be an extremely unusual request, but would it be alright if I used your restroom?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, dear. That would be no problem at all,‚Äù she replied. I was looking at her through the rearview mirror and thought I saw her right eye twitch. Must have been my imagination.

We‚Äôd arrived at a seemingly average suburban house. The kind with a white picket fence and a well-maintained front lawn. Nothing out of the ordinary.

‚ÄúThank you for the ride, Yasmin. Shall we?‚Äù Lauren asked me as she exited the car. I followed suit and accompanied her to the front door.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre actually having a small get-together at the moment,‚Äù she said to me and spun around to ring the doorbell before I could respond.

A young woman had answered the door. Again, very attractive. Man, what do these people eat?

She had similar features to Lauren, which lead me to believe they were sisters. They had the same brown hair and green eyes.

‚ÄúOh, hello,‚Äù the young woman greeted us.

‚ÄúRose, this is Yasmin. She‚Äôs here to use our restroom,‚Äù Lauren explained. ‚ÄúYasmin, this is Rose, my younger sister.‚Äù

‚ÄúNice to meet you. Sorry for the intrusion,‚Äù I apologized.

‚ÄúNo apologies necessary, dear. Come, let me show you the way,‚Äù Rose said as she took my hand and led me inside. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre actually having a small get-together at the moment.‚Äù

That was‚Ä¶ eery. The way they spoke was nearly identical. Rose even said the exact same thing Lauren did. And the way Rose called me ‚Äòdear‚Äô when I was probably a decade older than her.

When we went through the dining room, I saw their ‚Äòsmall get-together‚Äô. There were at least ten other people in the dining room. They all had the same brown hair and bright green eyes. Even if they were all related, it was strange how even the shade of brown and green remained consistent.

I felt a chill run down my spine. The way they were all just‚Ä¶ sitting there, staring at the food in front of them. Perhaps they had been waiting for Lauren to arrive, but it was still a disturbing sight to see.

I couldn‚Äôt help but breathe a sigh of relief when we exited the dining room. Partly because, what the fuck? And how I was seriously about to shit myself.

‚ÄúHere we are. Please let me know if you require any further assistance. I‚Äôll be in the dining room,‚Äù Rose said as she walked away.

‚ÄúThanks!‚Äù I called after her.

I shut the door and was finally able to relieve myself. I checked my phone to see if I received any messages from my cousin, Samantha.

&#x200B;

**Wednesday 8:13PM**

*Samantha: Hey, Yas. Successfully put the kids to bed.*

**Wednesday 10:47PM**

*Me: Thanks, Sam! I‚Äôm just making a quick pit stop and I‚Äôll be headed home soon.*

*Samantha: All good! Take your time. I‚Äôm just watching some TV.*

*Me: Alrighty. I‚Äôll call you when I‚Äôm on the way.*

*Samantha: Okay, stay safe!*

&#x200B;

I pulled my pants back on after cleaning myself and then flushed the toilet. As I washed my hands, I noticed something off about the mirror. It seemed as if it was a part of the wall. That kind of made the alarms in my head go off.

I read about this somewhere. I needed to confirm my suspicions, so I placed my finger on the mirror. There was no gap. It was a two-way mirror. I nearly jumped out of my skin when I heard a knock on the door.

‚ÄúYasmin, is everything alright in there?‚Äù I heard Rose ask me from the other side of the door.

‚ÄúY-Yeah, sorry! Be out in a sec!‚Äù I told her.

I looked away so that my back was facing the mirror and shot Samantha a text message. I told her to call me if I didn‚Äôt get to call her first within the next 15 minutes. I put my phone back in my pocket and walked out into the hallway where Rose was waiting.

‚ÄúWe were wondering if you would like to join us,‚Äù she smiled at me. It was unsettling, as if she was up to something. It was like I could almost‚Ä¶ see it in her eyes. Something behind them that I couldn‚Äôt explain. I felt conflicted, like I wanted to get the hell out of there, but I was also extremely curious.

‚ÄúNo, I shouldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I have to get home, it‚Äôs getting late,‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll just be for a bit,‚Äù she said as she took my hand once again and led me toward the dining room. The only empty seats were beside Lauren, so I decided to sit next to her. Rose took the other empty seat beside me.

I noticed a huge painting on the wall from across us. It was a painting of a handsome man, with chestnut brown hair and eyes like evergreens in a forest. He looked inviting ‚Äî warm, almost. Like a familiar face in a room full of strangers. Which was impossible, since I‚Äôd never met him before. I just felt‚Ä¶ comfortable.

I decided to ask about the man. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the guy in the painting?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh! That‚Äôs Father,‚Äù Lauren answered eagerly.

‚ÄúI can, uh, see the resemblance,‚Äù I said awkwardly.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too kind, dear. Isn‚Äôt she just lovely?‚Äù

Everyone in the room nodded along and agreed with Lauren, some of them even decided to throw in their own compliments. I was confused because my statement was fairly neutral.

‚ÄúYou should eat, dear, lest the food gets cold,‚Äù the man who sat across me suggested.

I looked at the plate in front of me. It was a relatively normal meal. Mashed potatoes, roast chicken, and some steamed vegetables. I looked at everyone else‚Äôs plates and realized that they had been untouched.

‚ÄúWhat about you guys? Aren‚Äôt you gonna eat too?‚Äù I asked hesitantly.

‚ÄúYes, of course. But we believe the guest should do the honor of starting us off,‚Äù another man stated.

I took my fork and picked up a piece of chicken, but my phone rang. Saved by the bell.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, let me just take this phone call. You guys can eat ahead,‚Äù I said as I started to get up.

‚ÄúThat won‚Äôt be necessary, dear. We don‚Äôt mind if you take the call here.‚Äù Rose took my hand and gently pulled me to sit back down.

‚ÄúRight, okay‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered then proceeded to answer Sam‚Äôs phone call.

&#x200B;

*Samantha: What‚Äôs wrong? Where are you? It‚Äôs getting late.*

*Me: Hey, Sam. I‚Äôm so sorry, I might be home later than expected. Do you think you could stay a bit longer?*

*Samantha: Yas, are you okay? You told me to call you in 15 minutes.*

*Me: No, it‚Äôs alright. Make sure you put the lasagna in the fridge.*

*Samantha: YASMIN?!*

&#x200B;

I hung up the phone and looked around. Everyone stayed silent as they watched me with their emerald eyes. ‚ÄòLasagna in the fridge‚Äô was our code for trouble. I silently prayed that she had gotten that.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a good mother, Yasmin,‚Äù Lauren remarked. Everybody else agreed and started fawning over me.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù was all I could say in return.

I decided to focus on my food instead. I took a bite of the unassuming mashed potatoes and was pleasantly surprised. It was just the way I liked it. Creamy and buttery with a few chunks in each bite.

‚ÄúWow, this is great,‚Äù I blurted out without meaning to.

‚ÄúOf course, dear. This is Father‚Äôs recipe. Everything he does is absolutely great,‚Äù Rose said proudly.

‚ÄúYes, Father does no wrong,‚Äù the man across me agreed.

I decided to try the chicken next. I could see why they liked this Father guy so much. He had some really good recipes. I ended up eating everything on my plate. Everyone else finished all their food too. I mean, who could blame them?

‚ÄúThank you so much for the lovely meal. I enjoyed it. But I really do have to get home to my kids now,‚Äù I announced.

‚ÄúI hope you still have room for dessert!‚Äù Lauren said as she entered the dining room, holding a covered round plate. I didn‚Äôt even notice her leave the room. I must have really enjoyed that meal.

There was a voice in my head that kept trying to remind me that I really needed to get home. To get to my kids. To get away from this place. But once Lauren revealed the cake, all I wanted to do was eat it. And that terrified me.

That fear went away as soon as I dug into my slice of cake. It was divine. I must have finished the whole thing in one bite. It was literally *the* perfect chocolate cake. Each layer was moist, yet still retained its fluffiness, and the chocolate ganache was to die for.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting late, dear. Maybe you should stay the night?‚Äù Rose suggested.

No. I needed to get away from this place and whatever the hell was going on here. I had to take my kids to school in the morning. Sam was waiting for me, she probably wanted to go home too.

‚ÄúThat sounds like an absolutely great idea, dear,‚Äù I responded. I had no idea why I said that.

Rose‚Äôs smile turned sinister, as if all the grace and innocence had left her face. Like she had a mask on the entire time and had finally revealed what was underneath.

Her voice remained sweet when she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure Father would think the same way as well.‚Äù

She led me to the guest bedroom and said goodnight to me, that she would see me in the morning, all the while having that menacing grin on her face.

Once she shut the door, something snapped in me, as if I had just woken up. I checked my phone and saw that I had a dozen messages and a few missed calls from Samantha. One of her messages stated that she called the police and that they were on their way.

I sighed in relief. Everything was probably going to be fine. The Uber app had the info of where my last drop-off location was and the cops were going to arrive any minute.

I decided to have a look around the bedroom while waiting. Maybe there was something I could use as a weapon, in case they tried anything before the police arrived.

On the wall behind the bed, there was another large painting of the man they called ‚ÄòFather‚Äô. I still felt the same way about him when I saw the first painting. I was almost sad this place was probably going to get busted and shut down or something.

I looked at the wall across the bed and there was a mirror that looked to be a part of the wall. Just as I was about to do the two-way mirror test again, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. What I saw made my blood run cold.

Financial Independence gave me confidence to stand up against bad managers,financialindependence,440,x55w78,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/x55w78/financial_independence_gave_me_confidence_to/,50,1662242021.0,"TL;DR: Being financially independent gave me confidence to not give two f\*\*ks about my company's new a-hole management team and allowed me to really consider my next career move.

===

New management came in and turned my laid back small company into a corporate, always in meetings, nightmare. The new managers ""brag"" about how they worked over the weekend and how they stayed up until 2 a.m. working on some report. That ain't me. I have hobbies and a life.

I got into it with one of the managers and there is no mistake in our dislike for each other. I figure the only reason why they haven't fired me by now is because they're so incompetent that they have no idea what I do. I create all the weekly reports reviewed by the executives, and they can't even figure out how to run the reports themselves. When they ask me to show them I make it sound overly complicated and their ADHD brains get overloaded after 5 minutes of my made up technical jargon (they have no background in my field).

If I weren't already pursuing FIRE and am somewhat FI by now, I'd be stressed out and worried about my job. But I've been pursuing FIRE for the past 20 years...I have a paid off house, a hefty retirement account ($600K in my early 40s), a taxable brokerage account ($100K) and a large cash account (I like keeping 1 year in emergency savings). I'm probably the best one at my company at my age to handle a job loss that wasn't born into money.

So I've been the only employee in my group since the new management came that is still working standard business hours. I don't go into the office on weekends or work long hours to satisfy or impress them.  Since we can work remotely, I went to Hawaii for two weeks and worked during the business hours and didn't even tell them (never heard of them checking for log on locations and doubt they know how). During my vacation, they wanted me to go into the office for a task that I could do remotely, but they wanted to be a-holes. I completed the task remotely and sent an email to the entire department explaining how the task can be performed remotely and how employees do not need to go into the office for this task. This pissed them off because my e-mail wasn't approved by a manager, but now all the junior employees know the managers are being a-holes if they tell them to go into the office for this task.

I've also been job hunting on the side. Let me tell you...job hunting when you're not worried about paying bills is sweet. I had time to decline some job offers if I didn't feel right about the company. I'm now with the (good) problem of having to choose between two job offers...a risky startup for more money and better opportunities for growth....or a Fortune 500 company that may be stodgy but stable. The startup will require that I work more hours, but I'm really tempted by the paycheck and growth opportunities. I also think having a Fortune 500 company may look good on my resume and it sounds like I will have the time schedule that I want. I feel so blessed to be in this situation.

So this upcoming week after Labor Day, I'll be choosing between one of my offers and likely turning in my 2-week resignation. Being FI allowed me to handle this hell chapter of my career pretty well."

He is fine just slightly confused and I‚Äôve told him that it was a stupid idea.

I‚Äôm keeping an eye on him but I don‚Äôt think he drank any or smelt enough to kill him.

This post is also to help spread awareness of the dangers of bitter almonds.

Edit: my friend is fine just felt a bit sick, we called posing control and they said he will most likely be ok just keep a close eye on him.

Edit 2: apparently there is a lot of people who didn‚Äôt know that this could be a bad idea so hopefully we can all learn what not to do with bitter almonds and maybe this is a good reason to stay away from them unless you know what you‚Äôre doing."

Awhile ago we were getting down and I start choking her and told her ‚ÄúI want you to go goblin mode on this dick‚Äù. I swear I could pinpoint the exact moment all of the moisture left her body. She asked me to stop so I did. She left the room and locked herself in the bathroom to ‚Äúquestion her life choices‚Äù and now things are awkward. We haven‚Äôt had sex in weeks. She ignores the memes I send her. The last thing she said was the internet isn‚Äôt real life and she‚Äôs having a hard time finding me sexy anymore. I don‚Äôt know how I can recover from this. 

TL;DR was fucking my gf, told her to go goblin mode on this dick. Turns out that‚Äôs the worst thing to say if you do want someone to go goblin mode on you."

We have 2.6 lakh members in this sub, many inactive sure‚Ä¶ but enough to make a real dent in local body elections or upcoming BBMP elections
Let us discuss and use our votes wisely.

I‚Äôm considering the BNP - bangalore navinirman party.
They are educated folks who might have less corruption within their ranks, as they have more of the lawyers, educators etc.

They have no plans of scaling nationally etc and might actually understand the plight of real Bangaloreans.
Even if they don‚Äôt win, we send out the messages that our city doesn‚Äôt accept goons as election winners.

If anyone has better ideas, we are all ears!
Thanks!

Not as common as a Pidgey, but available. 

The in-universe explanation for starters has always been that they are ""very rare"" in their home regions, but that implies they are common elsewhere.

Maybe Torchic is native to the jungles of Alola.
Maybe Squirtle is native to the ponds and lakes of Galar.
Maybe Froakie is native to the swamps of Sinnoh.

Would you feel like it would diminish the legacy of old starters to have them be even more available than they are now?"

I‚Äôve also managed to hide enough of my mistakes through the years that my wife thinks I can fix anything. Some days I really think I‚Äôm something great. And then, I do something so stupid that I think it is a miracle I don‚Äôt walk in to oncoming traffic regularly. 

Today was my first toilet instal. I removed the old toilet and then did something I saw my dad do several times growing up. I stuffed a rag down the pipe after removing the old toilet to keep all of the fumes at bay. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs necessary if you work quickly, but it is something I just had filed deep in my brain from watching my dad. 

I cleaned up the old wax and got the new toilet ready to go. I applied the new wax ring and carefully guided the bowl on to the flange. I was by myself and was a little worried about this part, but I did it perfectly! Damn I‚Äôm such a great handy man. I can do anything! I laughed at myself for buying an extra wax ring. That type of move is for guys who aren‚Äôt literally Tom Silva like me. 

I bolted her down, added the tank, and hooked up the water line. I reached to turn the water back on thinking about how smoothly this went when it hit me‚Ä¶ I am an idiot. I scoured the bathroom but couldn‚Äôt find it. Digging through the trash I knew my search was futile. I left the rag in the pipe. I left the freaking rag stuffed in the pipe. 20 minutes later I was thankful I bought an extra wax ring."

The Br√¥khyr act as overseers here.

\-successful developments and innovations are called a Br√¥khyr signature

\-much of the Leagues tech is reminiscent of the Imperium's

\-Volkanite weapons have remained the same, with few alterations 

\-other technology and weapons use energy sources beyond the scope of humanity 

\-Gifted Ion technology to the tau, and assisted in the development and application of the technology, but kept the latest developments to themselves

\-The Br√¥khyr have mastered the manufacturing of Focusing lenses and other components necessary to produce a sustained stream of energy

\-focused beam technology can be used on and off the battlefield, such as mining 

\-Many weapons are augmented with HunTR modules, which connects to the Kins neural implants, and help bring the best possible firing solution that can be achieved 

\-plasma blades can be made entirely of plasma

\-has concussion weapons like mass drivers

\-much of the kins weapons contain exotic material not found outside the galactic core, such as dark star ore, which is mined from the fringes of dead zones

\- Dark star ore is extremely dangerous to life, as just a single cut can cause death as the universal dampening field the material emits can halt all mechanical and organic functions 

\-Because of the dangers, the material is mined and shaped with exceptional care, and is only wielded by those who could be trusted with such a equally dangerous and tactically valuable weapon

\-pan spectular scanners allow the Kin to find a enemy‚Äôs location, not only through walls and objects, but also through the warp

\-They have almost flawless teleportation technology, so kin can be deployed without significant risk. It can even be used tactically.

\-Thanes cast a light in the warp to a far lesser degree

\-The lights from the core allow the Kin to calculate travel based on these lights

\-imperial warp travel is one of the few instances in where the imperials method is superior to the Leagues (in terms of speed), however the Leagues wisely avoid the risk associated with the Imperium's way of warp travel, and prefers slower travel

\-warp drives and Gellar field are superior to the Imperium‚Äôs, making travel safer and more reliable 

\-the Kins cloneskins have spiritual resilience 

\-they can scout for minerals and space hulks while in the warp

\-their shielding developments are also prevalent in the physical realm, with weave field generators employing a technique where different energy fields overlap and interlock over a range of frequencies and exotic energies

\-weave field generators are compact and efficient, and can be use as personal shields and can even be projected onto entire areas, which is useful for mining 

\-The Leagues conduct resource extraction and technology developments on a vast scale, making the Imperium look puny in comparison

\-the Kin ask ""why dig for the ore required, wasting time and lives, when the asteroid or world in question can be torn apart, and the remnants plucked out the wreckage"". ""When someone has what you want, why not take it""

\-global magna extraction and tectonic \*delving? Allows the Kin to harvest whole world's, populated or not.

\-has stellar siphons that drain the stars themselves as the cithonic mining guilds take whatever resources they need

\-even the most terrifying of galactic phenomena are reaped through atom delving and transotheric resubstantiation 

\-the Kin have no compunctions about tearing open the crust of a world whilst the population still dwells upon it

\-sometimes a evacuation can be negotiated 

\-on occasion, a resistant population may be deemed too strong for the prize to be worthwhile, but most of the time any resistance will be swept aside or ignored 

\-the Kin view these resources as theirs, by the right of might, and will use that strength to remove any impediments.

\-the Kin are resolute and rational and approach diplomacy the same way they approach anything else in life

\-the Kin may have a grudge that makes them lose perspective, and pursue a foe without hesitation 

\-the Leagues of Votann trade outside the core through a range of names, though these are rarely of their choosing 

\-this has caused confusion and misunderstanding over who these mercenary adventurers really are

\-to the Leagues, the tau are a young and naive people, though they appreciate the value of the greater good as it shares similarities with their own philosophy, putting Kin first

\-the tau are more than happy to pay the Leagues, though the Kin rarely share their more advanced developments 

\-Kin ion tech is superior and far more compact to the tau's 

\-a point of contention is the refusal by the Leagues to join the tau empire

\-the tau actually think the few ships they see from the Leagues are all that is left of the Kin, following a invasion from the tyranids. These rumors have been rebuffed by the kin, much to the confusion of the tau

\-the Kin see no value in enlightening them in this regard so long as the can continue to profit from trade with the naive civilization 

\-with the advances of the empire in the Chalnath expanse, there have been some clashes with the various factions of the Kin, which may have soured some local relations

\-tyranid invasions have caused an incalculable amount of damage to the Kin

\-known as the bane, the hive fleets are given a grudging respect for their effectiveness, but the Kin have no pause in hunting them down should they stand in between them and their prize

\-the tyranids consider the Kin to be another source of biomass and will descend upon their worlds like any other 

\-if required, the Kin will relocate should the predicted loss of life be too great, even dragging entire worlds to new locations, or they will stubbornly hold their ground should that be called for

\-such was the case with the Northstar cluster,  where the bioforms exhibited a odd nesting behavior not seen elsewhere. They have proven difficult to eradicate, and have brought devastation to the urani

\-the Kin see the danger of the tyranids, following the destruction of the \*ennburg eight near block? It was made up of a few dozen kindred and found themselves in the path of hive fleet Leviathan. The League was wiped out. The votann was left untouched. It absorbed the bodies of its fallen Kin to deny the tyranids, and was driven mad, becoming the mad core, and causing fluctuations in the warp that disrupt travel and has become a no fly zone

\-interactions with the aeldari have been somewhat limited, with most meetings being brisk, as the arrogance of the craftworld aeldari is somewhat irksome. The dark eldar and Harlequins are avoided.

\- the exodies are more tolerated by the Leagues due to their more pratical nature. Unless their world is considered a suitable target for prospects.

\-when it comes to the worshippers of chaos, the Kin are typically disgusted by the strange rituals, and have little time for such gruesome and foolish activities"

i'm a male and i've always been insecure about my recessed chin, all it took is 10 minute and 1 ml of filler in that area to make my whole appearance change. i feel 110% more confident and wish i've done it sooner instead of listening to judgemental people.

Remember that kid you used to babysit when I was little? 

Remember when I was 16 and punched him in the face, and I told you I punched him because I was sick and tired of him molesting and trying to r*pe me?

Well, I found today that he died.

I can't talk about this with anybody in my real life. 
I can't tell you, because I would burst into hysterical laughter and you would tell me not to speak ill of the dead.

I'm a grown woman now, with a 16 yr old daughter of my own. I've never ever forgotten what Donald did to me. 

And now he's dead. 

And I'm REJOICING inside.

Is that wrong? 

I always wished to see this day. 

The anger that this boy buried in my heart. 

The distrust, the disgusting way he made me see myself all those years ago.

Yeah, therapy has been great for me. It's been a couple decades and I'm still in therapy, working on trust issues. 

I feel like I can't tell anybody about the absolute RELIEF this news brought to my soul. 

He was a shitty person to me. My childhood friends are all mourning him. Even the ones who know what he did to me. And I'm over here, trying to keep my mouth shut. 

Am I a bad person for praising the gods that he is finally gone from this earth?

I feel relief, but I feel guilty for feeling this way.."

Today the Swedish Government did a press release stating the following:

""High and volatile electricity prices have greatly increased the collateral electricity producers must provide to the central counterparty, Nasdaq Clearing AB. This has led to a lack of liquidity at the companies, which risk ending up insolvent in the central counterparty despite being fundamentally sound. The market situation also means that losses by a member may cause difficulties for Nasdaq Clearing to manage these losses. As Nasdaq Clearing is a central part of the financial infrastructure, prompt guarantees from the state are therefore required to guarantee financial stability.""

The same goes for all parties around europe, every little energy producing company is earning big money but might get insolvent due to lack of liquidity....

And the electricity prices will rocket since we are heading toward winter...

Brace for Impact Dow J and Nasdaq......

I just had surgery, less than 48 hours ago. It wasn‚Äôt a major surgery, it was a gynaecological surgery. I was sent home an hour after surgery, all they checked were my vital signs in order to send me home. Long story short I‚Äôm currently having complications. I ended up at the ER for a few hours yesterday and was sent home with just enough improvement in order to kick me to the curb. 

Today I‚Äôm having the same complications, it‚Äôs getting worse. 

I just showed up at the ER and we‚Äôre told that they would take our names and call us in when space permits.

I‚Äôm sitting outside on the curb post surgery. I can barely get up off the ground. There‚Äôs 0 staff out here. What I‚Äôm experiencing is a medical emergency on the curb, yet it could still be much worse. People could die out here. 

What the fuck is wrong with this province. We‚Äôre fucked"

With the recent announcement of the Spelljammer Hadozee errata and Dragonlance and Planescape on the horizon... don't buy the hype.

Your favorite YouTubers are going to be pushing pre-orders. You're going to get bombarded by targeted marketing pushing pre-orders. You're going to feel the hype.

What we've seen from Spelljammer is that Wotc will spend a bunch of money on marketing and almost nothing on content to capitalize on pre release hype, push out a botched product and repeat.

Can always wait and see. Maybe the book is great and if so, wonderful. Will waiting a week or two for the newest book kill you? Don't feed the behavior we as a community don't want to see."

The past two days, I actually completed two hours of work a day, and then two and a half, and today, I completed four (and I‚Äôm still going!). I couldn‚Äôt be happier right now.

What worked for me is doing an adapted form of the 25-5 pomodoro method and actually doing 25-15 instead. When I tried doing it with a 5 minute break, it was way too short for me to actually feel relaxed enough to get back to work. I‚Äôd inevitably click ‚Äúrepeat‚Äù on my timer or just ignore it completely which built on my feelings of guilt and distrust in myself to be productive. I am trying to be gentler with myself this year, and more realistic, and it‚Äôs already working!

Something else I am finding incredibly helpful and motivating is tallying my 25 minute work slots every time I get one done. Every day I‚Äôve been trying to beat it with one more tally until I get to a level where I‚Äôm happy with the amount of work I‚Äôm doing and can keep it up.

Also, I am counting everything during those 25 minutes: studying, organizing, cleaning, and other things I find difficult to do to motivate myself. I found that this helps keep me going cause adding to those tallies and seeing that visual progress just makes me want to keep going. I‚Äôm not counting exercise but I have also been cycling in addition to the work I‚Äôve been doing. Just wanted to share in case any of this is helpful ‚Äî and also just because I really wanted to share the achievement haha."

I've noticed how since mormons aren't allowed to do certain things, they somehow find a substitute to make up for that.

For example, instead of sex, heavy makeout session.

Well, since mormons can't drink coffee or alcohol, I've seen they make up for these with sugary drinks, and they tend to develop a very sweet tooth. Its insane to me the amount of sweets mormons consume, especially the ones from Utah. Also, almost every stake president or bishop in these areas seem to be addicted to some Cola drink."

Me and a couple of friends went to a coffee shop and bought a gram of every strain of weed and hash they had, spending roughly 350‚Ç¨.

I cannot express how good it felt to smoke Sour Diesel and Green Crack in the morning, and Northern Lights and Green Mint in the evening.

Just walking around the city, rolling and smoking while walking in the street. 

It was the first time in ten years I smoked GRAMS a day and didn't feel a sliver of anxiety or paranoia. I felt like I was on perfectly mixed speedball ALL THE TIME.

Every day I was there felt like Christmas when you're a kid.

You Americans and Canadians don't know how good you have it. 

And yes I know that novelty would wear off quickly if I lived there and whatever but man...

Upon returning to my town in the Balkans, I took a couple of hits of Albanka‚Ñ¢ thinking it won't be an issue because, as I said, I was smoking thick spliffs in Catalonia.

I got so paranoid I had to go home and sleep.

I like to make posts around the anniversary of the cases, and this particular case occurred 6 September 2008.

[These two girls](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.cbc.ca%2F1.1700164.1379087670!%2FhttpImage%2Fimage.jpg_gen%2Fderivatives%2F16x9_780%2Fhi-ott-odjick-alexander-852.jpg&f=1&nofb=1) are from near Maniwacki, Quebec. It's located roughly 135 km north of Ottawa, Canada's capital, and about 300 km northwest of Montreal, Quebec. Both are quite tall - Shannon is 5'9 and about 140 lbs, while Maisy is about 5'10 to 6' and roughly 130 lbs. There is potentially some hope in this case.

**Background**

Maisy, aged 16, and Shannon, aged 17, went to Maniwaki Arena on the night of 5 September 2008, where several of their classmates confirmed their presence. Some sources say it was a school dance, others say it was a party. After they left, Maisy slept at Shannon's house. Bryan Alexander, Shannon's dad, was travelling the next day to Ottawa to help his son paint his house, so Shannon walked him to the bus stop, while Maisy slept in.

**Case**

Bryan came home and discovered the girls were not there. He was confused as all their belongings were still there - their backpacks, Shannon's medication, clothing, their wallets. Unfortunately, the girls were nowhere to be found. 

Laurie, Maisy's mom, tried to get in touch with Maisy as she had been told to do so before leaving for the dance, but she could not reach her. The next day, Laurie went over to the apartment where she and Bryan exchanged information, worrying about their daughters were. Laurie started calling their friends, getting any small tidbits of information about their last movements. Some sources say the girls were reported missing on this day, others say they were reported missing on the 9th (Maisy) and 10th (Shannon).

**Initial investigation**

Maisy lived on the local Native reserve, so her case was handled by the Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg PD, while Shannon's case was handled by the Quebec Provincial PD. Bryan's apartment was not searched, the media wasn't immediately informed of their disappearances, and the families did not receive official case numbers. Laurie said, ‚ÄúI mean, even the chief and council, nobody ... it seemed like nobody cared at the time‚Äù. Maisy's case was officially transferred as of 2009 to the provincial police.

Initially, the Kitigan Zibi police said the two girls had run away, which the families believe has stalled the investigation. Their belongings were left behind and although the girls had left unannounced in the past, they'd call their families to let them know where they were. 

On 12 September, the Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg First Nation set up a press conference where Laurie and Bryan urged their daughters to come home, but sadly only the local paper and APTN (Indigenous Peoples news network) showed up.

On 23 September 2008, volunteers united to hang up missing persons flyers and combed the riverbanks on the reserve for the girls. They also did canvas searches (not sure what this means) in Ottawa and Gatineau (part of Quebec directly across Ottawa).

**Sightings and searches**

To help get word out about the girls‚Äô disappearances, Maisy‚Äôs aunt, Maria Jacko, set up [a website dedicated to the case](http://www.findmaisyandshannon.com/),  and a few weeks later, during the 2008 Thanksgiving long-weekend, a  search was organized within Ottawa, after there were several reported sightings in its neighbourhood, Vanier. Vanier is not the greatest neighbourhood - it has been known for prostitution, drug dealing, etc. One of my first write ups on here involved a woman who was last seen in the area and later found murdered. 

Search and Rescue Global One was invited to help participate in the  search in December 2008. They conducted two searches, with the first  involving the Ottawa Valley Search and Rescue Dog Association and around  100 community members combing a 5km area around Bryan‚Äôs apartment.

In March 2009, the Quebec police said there was reason to believe the girls could have run away, but didn't reveal any evidence because they thought it might interfere with the investigation. A second investigation by Search and Rescue occured in May 2009 but neither of their investigations uncovered any evidence.

According to tips, it‚Äôs possible Shannon and Maisy had been seen in  numerous areas around the eastern and southern areas of Ontario. The Ontario Provincial Police have added both girls to their missing persons website. There have been unconfirmed sightings of the girls in Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston (about 2 hours south of Ottawa), and Port Elgin (a port city 300 km west of Toronto). I have created [this map](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Maniwaki,+QC/Ottawa,+ON/Kingston,+ON/Port+Elgin,+ON/@44.9913577,-80.6846074,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m26!4m25!1m5!1m1!1s0x4cd06f7c0a1d5845:0x574e406c27934e6d!2m2!1d-75.9647519!2d46.3775167!1m5!1m1!1s0x4cce05b25f5113af:0x8a6a51e131dd15ed!2m2!1d-75.6971931!2d45.4215296!1m5!1m1!1s0x4cd2ab0674408ea9:0x76a5497715d6d9ea!2m2!1d-76.4859544!2d44.2311717!1m5!1m1!1s0x8829c9238c9eb579:0xa3195af79b722aad!2m2!1d-81.3929413!2d44.4340516!3e0) to show the different cities - it is only meant to show the locations of the cities, not that the girls necessarily followed this route.

**Follow up and new investigations**

In August 2011, authorities revealed the pair may have come into  contact with a local sex offender who died by suicide in July 2011 while being held in jail in Hull (Gatineau-Hull, very close to Ottawa), and left behind a suicide note. 

In December 2015, [age-progression sketches](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ctvnews.ca%2Fpolopoly_fs%2F1.2685149.1449159782!%2FhttpImage%2Fimage.jpg_gen%2Fderivatives%2Flandscape_960%2Fimage.jpg&f=1&nofb=1) were released to show what the girls might have looked like at 24 years old.

New information was received in July 2017, leading to a search of Pitobig Creek on the Kitigan Zibi reserve. Authorities had been led to believe that their bodies could be found there so they used a small excavator, dive teams, emergency unit, and a forensics team to search the water and surrounding area. Unfortunately nothing was found, and also that area was near a Speedway which had been expanded since their disappearance so the shoreline had been disturbed. 20 people were interviewed then.

Shannon‚Äôs family has been more private, as her disappearance has brought them a lot of despair. Shannon was a cadet and loved being in a leadership role. Laurie has said she continues/continued to receive calls from investigators.

I don't know how long this will be until I magically reach the end because there's a lot to unpack and I don't want to break any rules.

My boss hired a new girl, who is always confused and does not understand what her job is. She's been here for 3 weeks. Let me breifly try to explain what the job is. We take orders, we make the food & drinks, and serve it. We also clean. General things like sweeping, tables, bathrooms, dishes, any other messes or spills, etc. It's our job.

The new girl is, um, 'silently refusing' to learn anything, she's not doing bare minimum. Everyone is expected to hold up their end of the stick on their shifts here, and every single time someone comes in to relieve her of her shift the restaurant is same as DESTROYED. 

Food is everywhere, the ingredients are somehow all mixed together; I.e, shrimp in the cucumbers (literally how). Sticky surfaces. Tables are so nasty customers can't eat at them. Dirty floors. No napkins or untensils. She'll spend 15 minutes washing dishes and somehow none of them are clean. They all have to be rewashed by someone else.

My boss paired her with me to try and fix this, thinking she wasn't trained properly. We were supposed to work a 10hr shift together... Supposed to. My boss said to keep her busy, show her everything, make her do things that need done, do some hands on style training because that's how I learned so he thought that'd be best.

It wasn't. I tried everything he said and she attempted to argue. Things she actually said to me were:
""why wasn't I showed this before if we're supposed to do it?""
""I don't want to do this though""
""I didn't realize there was so much ...work""
""Why do I have to do it?!""
""God that's gross..""

Everything was a fight and a half. I ended up doing everything on my own, including the orders. She just sat down on and off, or would follow me around yet wouldn't do anything. She played dumb, too, just a dead stare with nothing behind her eyes when she didn't like what you were saying. And instead of staying the entire shift, she claimed she was told to leave by 3. I just let her go, mainly because I was having to work AROUND her, and sometimes my boss changes hours last minute. But when I let him know, he said he never said that and even sent me a screenshot of the schedule he'd given her. She was supposed to stay.

It was the worst shift I've had at this job. I've been here for same as 3 years and quite honestly, I've never met anyone like her. I've kept trying since, my boss has also tried, my co worker has tried. There's zero progress and she's been here for 3 weeks. 

She ended up arguing with my coworker because my coworker got upset by the lying the girl has started doing. She'll tell you she cleaned something and she never did. You'll be looking at a table covered in food and sauce and she'll swear that it's clean, she ""just cleaned it"". She's begun lying on us to the boss now, saying we're mean for putting a ""do not touch"" sticker on a tea butler, even after my boss told her it was to keep customers from messing with it. She also chose to lie on the boss, saying he said things he has confirmed he never said.

She refuses to wear a hat, and we're expected to because we are the ones making food. She argues every time and says ""it makes her look like a boy"" because her hair is short. She's also claimed that ""the boss said I don't have to wear a hat! We've already discussed it. He said I only had to wear it when I work with someone else because all of you are so...nit-picky!"" And once again, she's been proven false. My boss has never said anything of the sort and would never.

She doesn't wash her hands, ever. Not even hand sanitizer. She'll get sticky sauce on her hands and just ...leave it. Quite literally just has her hands sticky and does not wash it off. Customers notice, it's very seeable. She's leaving fingerprints of ick everywhere.

And a big thing that we're not allowed to do, is take food home. For a half shift  (3-4 hrs) it's a small meal, for a full shift (10hrs) it's a full sized meal. But you are not really supposed to leave the restaurant with it, my boss doesn't like it. He considers it theft or being sneaky with something. He doesn't want you hungry the entire time, you can eat it at the restaurant or take it home if you don't finish it on your shift, but don't sneak it out...And the new girl was taking 2-4 meals home every shift. That's 2-4 full sized meals at LEAST 4 times a week. She claimed the boss okayed her to do it and quote, ""he said dinner was on him! It's fine! Leave me alone!"" and understandably, my boss was irritated. She was told to never do that again, it's not allowed, nobody would ever tell her that. 

I'm beyond frustrated, and so is my co worker. My boss has began complaining about her as well. At first he wanted everyone to get along, and work it out but it's been 3 weeks, and she's made zero progress.  He wants to believe it's just new hire adjustment pains. But believe me, I've kept trying this entire time and I'm out of patience with her. I'm still scheduled to work with her. She told me she worked at Wendy's for a while, ""like, a year"", but I'm thinking she's never worked anywhere. Nothing is making sense. Wendy's is stricter than we are. I'm fine with her not actually working before, that's not a problem.

The problem is refusing to admit she doesn't know what she's doing, being dismissive if you try to help or show her how to do something, quite literally ignoring you with that ""duhhh"" look I mentioned, or giving endless excuses. I'm the only one working with her other than the boss, and he told her she has to listen to me when we're scheduled together. He told her that he wants her to learn what I do and ever since he said that to her, it's like it made it worse. 

Reddit, I am out of patience. She's making everyone's job harder, messing things up on purpose to be spiteful or get out of doing it. I haven't said anything to my boss yet. She's caused customer complaints as well because of the dirtiness of the store. She will not clean. People have turned around and walked out when they have seen her working in here. They don't want served by her. I'm tired of being nice and accepting because it's not getting me anywhere. But somehow being rough doesn't do anything either (as shown by my other coworker).

Any suggestions? Advice? What would you do?"

I figured maybe this type of listing could help us all find some modern films we appreciate. And five years seemed like a good number for that. you can also list your favorite and the best if you think they are separate things.


for example my favorite horror film in the past 5 years is 2018s The Void.  Great Lovecraft type film, i also think it makes an excellenr double feature with The Thing.


the best though in my opinion is the remake of Suspiria. i think its a better film than the original. and i think its an underrated masterpiece. its not for everyone and it has some flaws. but its a great film. 


how about you?"

More breadcrumbs to prove MIB is already on S5's loop in S2E4.,westworld,184,x58xkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/x58xkn/more_breadcrumbs_to_prove_mib_is_already_on_s5s/,23,1662250560.0,"I began a series rewatch just like a lot of other and while I was in S1 I read the theories here that MIB is already on a loop in S2.  I began my S2 rewatch open to that idea and keeping my eye open to any evidence one way or another.  

Since the beginning of this season MIB is absolutely certain he's playing a game that Ford made specifically for him.  He's not.  It's a test alright, but a test of his fidelity created by the Supreme Dolores.  Ford never once told him that he made a game for him.  Ford was consistent that his games were for the hosts in S1.  Why suddenly set this abrupt 180 after his death?  Makes no sense unless we think if it is a test... who is running it and what it the purpose?


Some others have posted here with their proof already.  I can't find a video link to the scene near the end of S2E4 where MIB and Lawrence's daughter speak but I had texted it to a friend.

MIB: 'You wanted me to play your game... and I'm going to play it to the bone.'

Young Girl: 'You don't understand the game we're playing.  If you're looking forward you're looking in the wrong direction.'

[When Arnold explained the journey to consciousness in S1 to Dolores he explained it not as a journey higher but a journey inward.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRIt9cQdScA&ab_channel=Futurescope)

In this scene MIB is on a loop in the future.  His decisions this time are to help Lawrence and funny enough the mccguffin is the same nitro that we saw Young William and Logan steal S1.  It's like Doloroes created another test for MIB with the same constants (the same hosts and the same nitro).  This time MIB makes a good choice and goes on."

Guest: ‚ÄúI need a room that day‚Äù 

Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but we‚Äôre fully booked. I don‚Äôt have anything available‚Äù 

Guest: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have any rooms?‚Äù 

Me: ‚ÄúYes, like I said we‚Äôre fully booked‚Äù 

Guest: ‚ÄúWhy?!‚Äù 

Me: ‚ÄúIts summer. People are travelling‚Äù 

Guest: ‚ÄúI get that but I don‚Äôt understand how you‚Äôre fully booked when I need a room in a couple days‚Äù 

Me: ‚ÄúGuests book ahead of time to ensure their room is reserved. It‚Äôs always suggested to book in advance for summer due to higher volume‚Äù 

Guest: ‚ÄúWell I didn‚Äôt plan to travel. It‚Äôs a last minute trip‚Äù 

Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry there is nothing I can do. I currently don‚Äôt have any cancellations‚Äù 

Guest just grunts and leaves hotel. 

Do people not know what ‚Äúfully booked‚Äù means? Like I‚Äôm not speaking pig Latin. You‚Äôre poor planning is not the hotels fault. Do you expect me to knock down some walls and build a new room for you?

I was a problem drinker, and it was affecting my health, relationships and career effectiveness. I tripped with my wife, felt profound renewed love for her and everyone in my life. Towards the end of the experience, we had a few hours left before we had to relieve the babysitter and stopped in an Irish pub. Im   Irish by heritage, and in my altered state, became keenly aware of how similar all the intoxicated young men in the bar looked to me and my brothers and cousins. They were obliterating themselves with alcohol, stumbling drunk, clearly doctoring their pain and anxiety with booze. I thought Bout the generations of men in my family that have lived their lives this way. I woke up in the morning, and ever since, alcohol has looked like nothing more than poison. I‚Äôve gone weeks without drinking, and without the desire to drink. No AA, no therapy. A powerful realignment. In the early mornings, when I‚Äôd normally be hungover, I‚Äôve been going to yoga classes. My body is already transforming. Down 25 lbs. I‚Äôm more patient with my children, more loving towards my loved ones and more accepting of myself. And I dont feel a need to trip again any time soon. Powerful stuff."

Pushing 90 degrees, 70% humidity, sunny, and me quickly shriveling up like a raisin. As I passed two guys in front of a warehouse loading up a truck, I heard one of them saying something about the westward facing sun and how it was the hottest part of the day, yada, yada, and then he turns toward me and says to his buddy, ""See that guy? That guy's a badass, right there,"" All I could think at the time was, ""Badass? Naaaa, more like a dumbass for running at this time of day.""

I‚Äôve been doing it for a few years and my party has been with me from my first drawing to my most recent.

They‚Äôve been super supportive, helping me figure out some stuff here and there, but lately they‚Äôve been a bit more distant about it. One of the players asked me if I‚Äôd be willing to do some character art for them and I told them my commission prices (which are very low) and they agreed. Well, everyone else caught wind and began asking for their characters.

I told them that it would take time and they probably wouldn‚Äôt see it for a while, and they were fine with it. But when I told them I take half the payment up front and the other half after it‚Äôs done, everyone blew up on me.

I was bullied into doing their character art for free, which I wouldn‚Äôt have minded as much if they had been more polite, but they even took credit for it in other servers. I saw one of them remove my watermark and advertise it as their own.

I‚Äôve recently started a project to animate a character‚Äôs backstory and the party was all over that. They kept pestering me about doing theirs. I told them that it is just a test for the most part, more of a personal thing. But they kept going.

I told them it‚Äôll cost a lot more than their character art and that I‚Äôd be charging per frame. This was a hill I would die on, and I did. For a few weeks they‚Äôve been nonstop bothering me about it, begging me to do animations for them for free. Last night during dnd, my character went down in combat. Everyone refused to help him up, even stabilizing him. They said he‚Äôd owe them, they‚Äôll take half the payment up front and half after.

Nobody would help him up, so the dm had an npc help out after my second failed death saving throw. Everyone blew up saying that they were gonna do it and that it was just a joke. Then they all got to berating me for things here and there. 

Then they told me that they wouldn‚Äôt be helping my character at all unless they get their own animations for free. I don‚Äôt really know what to do but they‚Äôre forcing my hand. All of the loot that was laid out for my character specifically, useless to the rest of the party, was taken and held at ransom. I‚Äôve been with this group for years and they‚Äôve never done anything like this.

Should I just suck it up and animate for them, should I stand my ground? Should I leave the table altogether?

Edit- Commission prices are below

$10 for a sketch

$15 for a flat

$20 for shaded

Then the price for animation would be the respective price per frame, a sketch animation would be $10 per frame

Edit 2 (electric boogaloo)- I am not taking commissions. Please stop asking. I only do stuff in person for now, if I wanted to sell I‚Äôd post an actual ad. I appreciate the love and interest but please stop."

[AKB48] The Story of the Elections and the Rivalry Between Maeda Atsuko and Oshima Yuko,HobbyDrama,165,x594om,https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/x594om/akb48_the_story_of_the_elections_and_the_rivalry/,14,1662251127.0,"#Team A

In fall of 2005, producer and lyricist Akimoto Yasushi had put his plan of creating an idol group that performs at their own theater every day into motion. His colleague Togasaki Tomonobu had secured an area to build the theater on the 8th floor of Akihabara‚Äôs Don Quijote. Now they needed members. Unlike his previous project, Akimoto elected not to put out wide-ranging TV ads. Instead, he believed that serendipity was important for this project, and put out posters, handed out flyers, and put ads in magazines. Twenty-four members were selected for the AKB48‚Äôs 1st generation. These members include [Itano Tomomi](https://i.imgur.com/erh5jUn.jpg), [Kojima Haruna](https://i.imgur.com/YQD6d9f.jpg), [Takahashi Minami](https://i.imgur.com/bDZcgnG.jpg), and [Maeda Atsuko](https://i.imgur.com/VEbyNki.jpg). 

Before applying, Maeda Atsuko was a very shy and introverted girl, who seemed to have no real interests and wasn‚Äôt a member of any clubs at school. She had a secret longing in her heart of wanting to go into entertainment, something she could never admit to anyone. While out with her mother one day, she saw a poster for Akihabara48 auditions, and read its words. ‚ÄúI want to meet the you that‚Äôs on the inside.‚Äù She immediately turned to her mother and said, to her shock, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to apply to become an idol.‚Äù

Takahashi Minami originally wanted to join a talent agency, and was selected to go to a local audition. She failed it. The judge was Akimoto Yasushi himself. When walking home after being rejected, Takahashi was handed a flier for Akihabara48. She decided she would apply, and she was selected to become a member. Why would Akimoto fail her for one audition and then approve her for the next? Well, serendipity is supposed to be important, and her birthday is 4/8 and her height is 148.5cm, matching the name Akihabara48. 

The 24 members of Akihabara48 were announced on October 30th. Opening night was set to be a month later, on December 1st. Four members dropped out during training. Kojima Haruna nearly dropped out herself, as the training schedule clashed with her part-time job, and she had to be convinced to choose becoming an idol over working her job. The members struggled to learn to sing and dance the 12 songs of their first set. Opening night was pushed back a week to December 8th. The members come out to perform their first stage, to an audience of 7 fans. The members were devastated, and had to be convinced by Akimoto to continue on. They performed every night, and three times a day on the weekend, and slowly the audience grew. In their 2nd week of performances, they were set to perform when right before the show started, the sound system of the theater broke down. The audience had grown to about 50 people at that point. Thinking fast, management decided that instead of a show, the fans would have a meet-and-greet with the members, and shake their hand. This was the birth of AKB48‚Äôs handshake event, their signature event. The equipment was fixed, and they continued to put on their first stage. However, the team was not yet complete. 

In January, the managers put out a ballot box. Fans would write down the name of their favorite member and put it in the box. One day, they received a ton of votes that said ‚ÄúMariko.‚Äù The problem was that AKB48 didn‚Äôt have a Mariko. Then suddenly they realized something. Wasn‚Äôt the girl they hired to sell ice cream and coffee at a booth in the theater named [Shinoda Mariko](https://i.imgur.com/6nTcKcd.jpg)? The fans were voting for the staff member who manned the ‚ÄúAKB48 Cafe‚Äù booth. Akimoto approached her and told her if she learns the songs by the next week, she‚Äôs in the group. 

AKB48 still hadn‚Äôt been signed to a label, but Akimoto wanted to release a single anyway. He found out that fans would gather at a family restaurant after the show, and sent Togasaki to the restaurant to talk to fans. He wanted to know which song from their first stage they would pick for a single. The fans picked Sakura no Hanabiratachi, a song about graduating from high school and would later become the go-to farewell song when a member graduates from the group. They released their first unofficial single on February 1st, 2006.

#Team K

AKB48 announced the 17 members of the 2nd generation in February of 2006. With the logic that it would be unsustainable to have the same group of girls perform every single night (and 3 times a day on the weekends), Akimoto decided to make a team system that rotated performances. The 1st generation became known as Team A and the 2nd generation as Team K. Team A did not take the news of a new generation well. They thought Akimoto believed that they weren‚Äôt good enough, and they were being replaced. A rivalry between Team A and Team K quickly developed. Team A and Team K perform different setlists, with different songs. Team K was full of members who were athletic and were good dancers, and Team K songs reflect that. One member of Team K immediately stood out: [Oshima Yuko](https://i.imgur.com/Iy95K3j.jpg). Oshima Yuko is the single most charismatic person I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs hard to describe in words, but whenever she stood on stage or on TV she was always the center of attention. She is hilarious, ridiculous, and infinitely loveable. She started as a child actress, and before being an AKB48 member she was a member of a failed idol group. Her dream was to become a renowned actress.

#A Star is Born

After adding the 2nd generation, Akimoto received many letters from fans. The common theme was that there were too many members, they can‚Äôt keep track of them. Akimoto and theater manager Togasaki decided that they needed a face for the group. A member that would stand out among the crowd. Suddenly, Akimoto says ‚ÄúI‚Äôve decided. It‚Äôs Maeda.‚Äù Togasaki was confused. He thought she was just a dull schoolgirl. Akimoto wrote Team A‚Äôs second stage, a setlist of new songs. In it is the song where‚Äôs Maeda Atsuko, ace, was made. The 4th song in the setlist, Nagisa no Cherry. Maeda is the main singer, with the other three members being backup. Initially, fellow 1st generation member Minegishi Minami refused to do it. Asking why should she, who‚Äôs the same age and generation as Maeda, be her backup? She only agreed to do it when she saw Maeda, in tears, begging the managers not to make her center. Eventually, AKB48 were signed by DefSTAR Records, a major label. They released their first official single, Aitakatta, on October 25th, 2006. It featured a selection of members from Team A and Team K, with Maeda as the center. From then on, Maeda Atsuko was the face of the group.

#Team B

On December 9th, 2006, the 13 members of the 3rd generation were announced. The new generation formed Team B.  [Watanabe Mayu](https://i.imgur.com/EyWL4MQ.jpg), from nearby Saitama prefecture, had failed the 2nd generation audition. [Kashiwagi Yuki](https://i.imgur.com/nwruAiU.jpg), who was a massive Hello Pro fan, had failed Morning Musume‚Äôs 8th generation audition. Team B featured many young and cute members, so their songs had a distinctive ‚Äúcute‚Äù aura. From the 4th generation onwards, members would first become kenkyuusei (literally, ‚Äúresearch students‚Äù) and be added to Team A, Team K, and Team B later on. They were added to the teams according to need and according to ability to maintain that team‚Äôs concept.

#Struggle 

AKB48 continued to perform at the theater and release singles, but going into 2008, they had yet to receive commercial success. Their 6th single sold a dismal 18,000 copies. After their 8th single, they were dropped by DefSTAR, and they released their 9th single online on Napster. AKB48 was hemorrhaging money, having to pay dozens of idols and countless staff, on top of rent for the theater. Many members figured it was over. But Akimoto continued on. They opened a second theater, in Sakae, Nagoya, and started SKE48. The ace of SKE48 was young member Matsui Jurina. In fall of 2008, AKB48 was signed to another major label, King Records. They released Oogoe Diamond, which featured a double center role of Maeda Atsuko and Matsui Jurina.

#The First Election

Having a total of 100 members between the two theaters, and only selecting ~20 members for a single, Akimoto constantly received fan letters complaining about his selections. ‚ÄúHow could you not put (member) into the lineup of the single?!‚Äù they‚Äôd ask. In 2009, Akimoto had had enough. He said ‚Äúfine, the fans get to pick. You buy a copy of the 12th single, you get to vote for the lineup of the 13th single.‚Äù After all, fan input had always been important to AKB48. And thus, the election was born. Fans bought copies of the 12th single, Namida Surprise, to vote for their favorite member. The top 21 vote getters would be the lineup for the next single.

AKB48 held an event to announce the winners of the election. Through hundreds of theater performances and appearances on their late-night variety programs, the early members had developed their trademark styles and personalities. [Itano Tomomi](https://i.imgur.com/Nqd2e8l.jpg) was the laid back, cool gyaru, [Kojima Haruna](https://i.imgur.com/mKEtZob.jpg) was the sexy gravure model who was a tennen boke (natural fool; airhead), [Shinoda Mariko](https://i.imgur.com/8CzxIsr.jpg) had model good-looks and her signature short cut, [Watanabe Mayu](https://i.imgur.com/udLoC4x.jpg) had her twintails and idol cyborg (so perfect an idol, she must‚Äôve been created in a lab) persona, [Takahashi Minami](https://i.imgur.com/S4SELAH.jpg) had her high ponytail affixed with a bow and was the natural leader and emotional core of the group, [Oshima Yuko](https://i.imgur.com/2YSjFX0.jpg) had her big personality and even bigger smile, and [Maeda Atsuko](https://i.imgur.com/eOCfXm9.jpg) had her reserved, pure image and bob haircut. They counted down the members. Seventh place, Itano Tomomi. Sixth place, Kojima Haruna. Fifth place, Takahashi Minami. Fourth place, Watanabe Mayu. Third place, Shinoda Mariko. Second place, Oshima Yuko. First place, Maeda Atsuko. Maeda had 4,630 votes to Oshima‚Äôs 3,345. 

AKB48 released their 13th single, with its selection voted on by fans, Iiwake Maybe. Its music video features a bicycling competition, and rivalry between Maeda and Oshima. While Iiwake Maybe didn‚Äôt have great sales, news reported that there was an idol group that had an election to decide their lineup, and they finally had mainstream recognition. Their next single, River, was their first to reach #1 on the weekly Oricon charts, and sold over 200,000 copies.

#The Second Election

In 2010, Akimoto and co decided to have a 2nd election for the 17th single. Just like the first, if you buy a copy of their latest single, you get a vote for the lineup of the next song. AKB48 had increased in recognition since the last election, and the votes increased as well. They count down the members. 7th place, Kojima Haruna. 6th place, Takahashi Minami. 5th place, Watanabe Mayu. 4th place, Itano Tomomi. 3rd place, Shinoda Mariko. 2nd place, Maeda Atsuko. 1st place, Oshima Yuko. Oshima defeated Maeda with a margin of 31,448 votes to 30,851 votes. 

AKB48 released their 17th single, Heavy Rotation, on August 18th, 2010. The selection chosen by fans, it was the first AKB48 single to not feature Maeda Atsuko as center, but instead had Oshima Yuko up front. It was an instant success. While the West knows it mostly for its raunchy (NSFW) music video, in Japan it became famous as a perfect karaoke song. It topped the karaoke charts for years, and broke the record for most weeks at #1 in karaoke. After 5 years, and 2000 theater performances, AKB48 was a success. 

Their next song, Beginner, sold over a million copies in the Oricon chart, becoming the first song in Japan to do so since 2007. AKB48 became a massive social phenomenon, and the top 7 members (who remained unchanged in the first two elections) became known to the world as the Kami 7 (the God 7), and all became huge superstars. They continued to release songs, and despite Oshima centering Heavy Rotation, Maeda continued to be the center for the other singles. 

There became a prevailing view among fans. In the 2nd election, they weren‚Äôt voting *for* Oshima, they were voting *against* Maeda. Or, more accurately, they were voting against management-selected favorites. It was a rebellion against Akimoto. Oshima happened to be the 2nd most popular member, and thus most likely to dethrone Maeda. After losing the center position, Maeda said that she herself was never fit to be center anyway, and she was fine with this result. She was lying. 

#The Third Election

Throughout 2010 and 2011, AKB48 released success after success. They dominated not just the music charts, but TV appearances, commercials, and magazine covers. Eventually, it became time for another election. AKB48 released Everyday, Kachuusya and the voting ticket along with it. Votes poured in, more than ever before. It came time to announce the winners. 8th place, Itano Tomomi, the first of the original Kami 7 to fall out. 7th place, Takahashi Minami. 6th place, Kojima Haruna. 5th place, Watanabe Mayu. 4th place, Shinoda Mariko. 3rd place, Kashiwagi Yuki. And 2nd place, with 122,843 votes, Oshima Yuko. 1st place was Maeda Atsuko with 132,892 votes. I have put some clips together from one of their documentaries, with English subtitles. [I highly recommend that you watch it yourself.](https://streamable.com/ag1z7t) It shows the announcements of the top two, their speeches, and the aftermath backstage. 

As Oshima‚Äôs name was called for 2nd place, you can hear Maeda wailing in the background. Oshima gave a speech about how the fans‚Äô votes represented their love, and thanking them for all the love they had given her. Maeda is called for 1st place and gives what became AKB48's most famous speech. She acknowledges that there are those that hate her. She asks them one thing: even if they hate her, please don‚Äôt hate AKB48. Behind the scenes, Oshima was inconsolable as she weeps into the chest of Shinoda Mariko. Maeda and her best friend, Takahashi Minami, cry into each other‚Äôs arms. Later on, Oshima goes to Maeda and congratulates her, telling her the fans picked her because she‚Äôs the true center. 

On August 24th, 2011, AKB48 released Flying Get, the song selected by the election. It was a massive success, surpassing any song AKB48 had released yet. It sold 1 million copies on the first day of release. AKB continued their dominance of the music chart and pop culture in general. 

#The End of the Rivalry

Maeda Atsuko announced graduation before the 4th election commenced, and Oshima Yuko easily won 1st place without a rival. AKB48 continued to release hit songs, and would go on to release 37 consecutive million-seller singles. Although the elections stopped after the 10th election in 2018, they continue to perform at that same theater to this day, now nearing 6000 performances."

"Backcountry Bourbon Mule, aka The Pack Mule",trailmeals,158,x59ho5,https://i.redd.it/h0krc4knnql91.jpg,12,1662252189.0,"A few weeks ago there was a discussion about backcountry cocktail recipes. I thought I‚Äôd share the bourbon mule recipe I developed as a result. 

1 packet of Trader Joe‚Äôs 100% ginger juice drink mix in about 12 oz cold water. 

2-3 packets of True Lime to taste. 

~3 T brown sugar (to taste, I didn‚Äôt measure). 

A pinch of cayenne pepper if desired. 

2-3 oz. of bourbon. 

You could easily swap out your spirits here. Prefer a Moscow mule? Bring vodka. Want a dark and stormy? Use dark rum. 

It was quite a nice drink at the end of a long hike. Cheers!"

They were tough, but fair, and didn‚Äôt mess around. Petty officer first class Smith, and petty officer first class Sloan. I‚Äôll never forget them.

One afternoon, maybe halfway through, we were in our barracks unsupervised, doing normal boot things. You know, cleaning, shining our boondockers, whatever. My bunk was closest to the outside door, and that‚Äôs where I was, doing my busy work, when out of the corner of my eye I saw PO Sloan walk in. I stopped what I was doing, stood up and turned to face him, and something wasn‚Äôt right about what I was seeing, but I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it.

PO Sloan walked straight up to me, and got right in my face. He did not look happy, and this was a man you *didn‚Äôt* want to piss off, so needless to say, I was more than a little nervous. That‚Äôs when I see it: he has a half inch chunk of white styrofoam stuffed part way up his left nostril.

Naturally I busted out laughing, unable to help myself. The next thing I know, PO Sloan is shouting at me, ‚ÄúLaughter is NOT authorized! Drop and give me twenty!‚Äù So I do, laughing even harder.

By this time the commotion had attracted the attention of the rest of the company, and guys started coming over to see what was going on. One by one they started laughing and getting dropped just like me.

PO Sloan began walking back to the office. By the time he got there we were all in stitches, and half of us were doing push-ups. I think I even saw the man smile."

He hid his family from me at the beginning but told me soon enough, I guess I didn't have to continue with communication, but I did despite knowing he had a wife and kids. My mistake. I think at that time I didn't really mind so much because he explained it as his family being really religious so he doesn't get that much from his wife and he is trying to satisfy his needs in order to remain a good family man. He made it strict he wants to have this affair completely seperate from his family life, because his life (and wife) is perfect.
He also told me he has had hook ups in the last few years quite a lot (10+ women) and even started looking for new mistresses while he was hooking up with me. 

Nothing excuses my actions, however I have to mention I was at a really low self esteem point when he came into my life, and after finding out he already has a good family I settled for being the other woman because I felt like I don't deserve more than that anyway. Selfish of me, yes, and also a self fullfilling prophecy.

I've finally come to my sanity, maybe just because I'm out of the infactuation stage and starting to realise he is untrustworthy and a liar (which yes, I should've known from the start) and I don't want anything to do with him anymore. Quite honestly, I see him as a dirty perverted man and I am disgusted with myself that I ever engaged with this.

I want to tell his wife about this. From what I've heard about her she is a woman of faith who takes care of this loser and his four kids all day every day,  lives her life for this family, is also well educated and takes care of her looks - stays fit. I don't know if it's a good idea to tell her though. Again, selfish reasons - he has my nudes and I'm worried how psychotic he can get. He obviously doesn't care for other people. I'm thinking of telling anonymously, but I think he could easily figure out it was me.
I also don't know how to contact her. She is not on social media neither do I have their address. All advice appreciated."

Throughout the summer they‚Äôve had me working 5 days a week and called me in on my days off. Whenever they didn‚Äôt, they‚Äôd just deal with nobody preparing the food for the next day. And when I‚Äôd return, they‚Äôd complain about them not doing it. I‚Äôm also the only person that cleans past the mandatory things. I clean under the soupwell, in the sinks, above the toaster, wherever people don‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm also the only person that knows how to. 

Now they have nobody to do it. I got tired of their bullshit and put in my two weeks after a shift last night - and immediately got job offers starting at CAD 16/hour, much above my pay of 14.15/hour. Fuck them.

I cried so hard while reading it (Maybe the most I've ever cried over a book) because of how close to home it hit. I really enjoyed it and it vaguely reminded me of The House on Mango Street, especially the shorter chapters we get in the book.

I read some reviews afterward and while I understand a few of those criticisms, I still love the book as a whole. I always fear that I only love a book because of my age and it isn't actually as wonderful as I think it is, but I enjoyed this book so thoroughly that I don't even care about that anymore.

I also feel like I liked it a lot more than other reviewers because it reminded me of my past experiences. I always felt so isolated by them, so to read about similar happenings feels so refreshing.

 Are there any books you have read that just made you cry over finally feeling seen/recognized?"

As this roadmap could be the final nail in the coffin for a lot of people. Today #Fire343 was treading. Now I don't want, and I think many don't want the developers to become jobless. While we don't know the full story I'm sure its not their fault. As looking at the industry many developers are overworked and underpaid. This situation falls on upper management, and It is fair to say there needs to be major shake ups. I'm sure they're many great people, however its not working. It hasn't been working for over 10 years. I think it is a fair question to ask can 343i handle the halo franchise anymore. interesting questions I know and wishful thinking. Xbox made 343i to specifically make halo content after Bungie's departure.  However, 343i has shown over the last 10 years they are struggling to make any content for us. Many broken promises and so on. This is an entertainment product after all. I think we should take a look back and think about this possible future.

Halo 4, being one of the most divisive games the community due to its multiplayer. Halo 4 took heavy inspiration form call of duty. That is where the multiplayer issues come into play introducing kill streaks, perks, customizable load outs, specializations. While all those are indeed interesting, not halo. To halo 4s credit it did a lot of stuff and they tried to make it work but it stumbled. Spartan ops very creative, forge at the time being one of the best. As well as great customization and graphics. However a very divisive art direction. Over all 4 was not great but it was not the worst.

Halo MCC, extremely ambitious not only would we get at the time halo 1-4 on Xbox one but also halo 2 anniversary. When it launched the game was plagued with crashes and bugs. Not only would certain halo games refuse to launch, but the multiplayer was completely broken as well. Extremely long que times random disconnects, horrible server latency. all this while the main team at 343 was working on halo 5. We kept getting a promise that they would fix it. However there was just dust and echos. It would take over 6 years later for the mcc to get into a stable condition. That was in thanks to many other studios work. with some 343 devs.

Halo 5, very questionable marketing to the point of misleading. We were told and marketed as this is a great hunt on our boy. Master chief seemingly going rouge. hunt the truth marketing with Benjamin Giraud. Game comes out there hardly is any hunting, poorly written characters and plot. This is all campaign related as well we haven't even gotten to the multiplayer. Multiplayer and marketing big push was on req packs for Warzone. remember the abused marking on those things. I encourage you to go back and watch them really anti consumer, to the point they tell you to shut up and buy them.  several multiplayer modes missing forge and firefight being two giant ones. lack luster customization, Buggy and broken theater. Horrible performance on the original Xbox one. finally no split screen co op. That was giant uproar in the community. for the first time ever, a main line halo game did not have split screen co op. It was so bad Bonnie Ross general manager at 343 had to make a promise that all halo games movie forward will have it. They know they missed the mark and will improve now, right?

I honestly don't even think I need to cover halo infinite as its so recent, but I will. Being the most expensive video game ever made clocking in at $500 Million! Was going to originally launch in 2020 with the Xbox series X and S. Promised us a return to form. The Halo Infinite show case 2020 arrives. Game play looks very promising graphics not so much. Game rightfully gets a delay. More details emerge Going free to play promised to put the ""community first"", that there will be no ""predatory microtransactions"". ""This will be the next halo for 10 years as a live service"". That we will be able to make ""our spartan how we want"". They were going to go to a ""player first mentality"". Games multiplayer launches for the surprise anniversary of halo CE. Turns out almost everything they promised us was a lie. Customization was water down to being locked to cores. Colors being locked to cores, helmets armors pieces everything. Armor sets being sold for $20. Battle pass being extremely grinding to a point it becomes a job. Missing progression system, several game modes and features missing. Extremely horrible server latency. Being told halo at its core as always been competitive when it never has been. Its been a party shooter game first competitive second, always! Game play is amazing yes but that's about all this game as going for it. with only so many modes and maps, it gets boring quick. Especially when the only thing to progress is a battle pass. Then recently another failed promise of missing split screen co op, and lack luster roadmap to season 3 while extending season 2 to ten months long.  This game cost 500 million to make..

I think it is extremely fair to ask the question can 343i handle halo after not one or two but four failed tries. We as a community are left wondering is this what is to become of halo. just sit and watch it die, with nothing we can do. Xbox head Phil Spencer once said ""If we lose our way with halo, we lose our way with Xbox."" Well Phil I think 343i and halo has lost its way. We as a community have given them time and time again. We let them make broken promises and lies right to our face. If halo is to ever get better there needs to be some serious changes. We as a community have to ask ""when is enough, enough""?

As a long time halo fan it pains me so much to see what the franchise has become. Halo was my first ever xbox game. I played it on the original Xbox as a 6 year old kid. Made so many memories and friends over the course of 20 years. It pains me so, to see what has happened. That there is only negativity. I have ranted a lot about the game(s) recently to the point I'm just giving up. I have tried to give 343i so many chances. I have tried being simple and giving constructive criticism. It is just in one ear and out the other with 343i. Nothing is going to change with them. I know 343i has some amazing and talented people. However, I think they need to try different projects, that the studio needs to try different projects. So we are left asking ourselves is this the new normal? Is this what we wanted, when halo was given a 2nd chance after bungie left. Halo needs another chance, just one without 343i.

Side notes; Well everyone that's my rant I made. Tried to keep it as civil as I could, I was/ am past my boiling point with this situation.  If you made it this far, thanks for hearing out my story/Discussion/Rant.  


Edit- Thank you all for the awards and reading what I had to say. Also those contributing to the conversation. I really wasn't expecting this to explode the way it did. I was just trying to get my frustration out."

advice on dealing with a friend who won't pay me for my work. it's really hit me hard and my confidence has been shaken...,painting,117,x5asq1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/x5asq1,36,1662256112.0,"Warning before reading: this is a long one and appreciate any advise. 

My friend commissioned me to paint a portrait of her dad's dog (pictured above). Due to her being a ""good friend"" and me only staring out on this journy of selling my art, I told her 50 bucks for the painting, which is a total steal given the time, cost of materials and effort I put into this piece. I'm a self trained artist and this is the second portrait I've ever painted in my life (and the second I've ever sold for actual money). All my friends and family know this about me (including my friend who commissioned me) and doing this painting was truly a learning experience. I loved the way it came out and am very proud of the final product. I really felt like I proved to myself that I have what it take to make appealing portraits (despite that small voice in the back of my mind saying I could still do better).

We've been friends since junior high and I started painting after I finished highschool back in 2010. It's been a long road for me to build up the confidence to start putting my artwork out on social media this past year and I've been getting a lot of great feedback from many people. 

It took me a little under two months to complete this piece and I honestly had no clue how long it was going to take me. I kept tell her that this is only something I do in my spare time. Reiterating to her multiple times that I work a full time job, I live on my own, I exercise, I sleep, I cook and eat, and I enjoy taking some down time here and there to relax. Despite all of these normal everyday things that I must do to survive/ stay sane she constantly kept asking me why I hadn't finished the painting when she wanted it done. 

I kept telling her next week I'll hopefully be finished, this went on for a couple of weeks, and at one point I was so fed up with her constant nagging I said I'd give it to her for free if it wasn't done in X amount of time. This was a joke of course and I stated that to her so she wouldnt actually expect me to give this to her for free (fuck that lol). That time came and passed and I still wasn't done but she finally got off my back and I finished the painting about two weeks later.

I hand delivered it to her place two days ago and she told me that she would have to pay me on her next cheque cause she had to pay rent and all her other bills (even though she told me she would pay once I brang it over). I said fine cause I would never expect someone let alone my friend to go without necessities just for a painting. 

She makes over 1500 bucks every two weeks and my other friend who she lives with told me she only pays 500 for rent plus her heat, light and internet. She was completely furious that my friend who commissioned me didn't pay me and called her out for buying alcohol, going downtown to party often, and always going out to eat at restaurants. I was shocked to hear this and felt very confused about why she couldn't pay me. Still giving her the benefit of a doubt, I rationalized that maybe she was having money problems cause I've been there and and know how hard it can be.

I went to a potluck with a few of my friend tonight and she was there but had to leave cause she had a shift at work about an hour after I got there. I jokingly said ""where's my money"" laughed and told her I was joking. We both joked around for a bit and then all of a sudden she left and blew up at me over text message calling me out for saying I would give it to her for free weeks earlier and that if she does pay me it wouldn't be until her next cheque or the next one after that.... it shocked everyone there and she caused a lot of drama (which I absolutely hate being a part of, literally do everything to avoid it and im the kind of guy who would literally give the shirt off my back to a stranger if they needed it).

I was able to calm her down over text while still holding my ground that I want to be compensated for my time and skills in the nicest way possible. All my friends and my boyfriend think I'm being too nice about it and were putting a lot of pressure on me to stand up for myself. I feel like I did that tonight but I also feel attacked for providing a service and wanting to be paid for it...

I feel depressed over this. My friend has been petty about this whole process. I have seen she has no respect for the process of making art and the time and skill it takes to make something beautiful. I feel completely disrespected and for it to be someone who's supposed to be my friend getting on this way has really hit me hard. If it was a stranger at least I could be impartial in some way even though I'd still be pissed that I wasn't getting paid in a timely manner.

I'm literally sitting here in front of another painting I'm doing and I feel defeated, like what's the point of even making art to sell... like I'll never actually be able get myself out there and be taken seriously as an artist...

Has anyone ever had a bad experience like this? I would love to hear some words of love and support

Thanks for taking the time to listen to my rambling"

Es hat insgesamt 3h gedauert vom verlassen des Gel√§ndes bis dass ich jetzt mal nach Bruck gekommen bin. 

Es war gro√ü angek√ºndigt, dass alle mit den √ñffis kommen sollen, aber die S8 ist trotzdem nur 1x in der Stunde gefahren. Aber die Shuttlez√ºge zum P+R sind eh alle 15 Minuten gefahren, aber viele wollten halt mit Z√ºgen zur√ºck nach wo auch immer und die mussten lange warten. Ich selber habe einen Zug verpasst. Dadurch eine Stunde gestanden. Und wie gesagt zu Fu√ü seit 3h unterwegs mit schwerem Rucksack.

Die √ñBB meint der Veranstalter h√§tte Z√ºge bestellen m√ºssen. Wie auch immer. Ich glaub im Ergebnis ist es relativ egal wer was verpennt hat, aber es waren viel zu wenige Z√ºge f√ºr die erwarteten 150k Leute (oder noch mehr?).

Das ist nicht nur √§rgerlich, sondern IMHO auch ein Sicherheitsproblem. Da h√§tte eine Panik wohl sehr schnell zu Problemen gef√ºhrt. Es war schon ziemlich offensichtlich, dass der Bahnverkehr unterdimensioniert war und egal wessen Schuld es war, aber das war einfach ein Witz."

https://preview.redd.it/ylqzul09vpl91.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=738f5fe235b684fe547d5aefa8d4d94d3a2cc7bb

Turns out that 42 civs are quite an amount, took a while to write of all that down, so prepare for a long ass post. **I hope that it will serve some beginners as some sort of guide where they can look up basic characteristics of civs.**

**Advice: First read the headlines and the short descriptions of the category below, before you dig into the specific civs.**

The order here is roughly by popularity of their go-to-strategy.

# Knight-Civs: Franks

**Usually you want to open up with Scouts and then go into Knights. Perhaps you need to add Skirms against Archers or Pikes. Sometimes you'll transition into the Unique Unit or maybe Scorps or Hand Cannoneers to support the Knights.**

* **Franks specifically** support this with several bonuses, most importantly the fact that you will never forget your farm upgrade as it's for free. Also faster berries and free HP-bonus on your Cavalry makes everything very easy for them. Crazy addition: your castles are mega cheap which can just kill the game once you have map control.
* **Berbers** **(Cheap Franks):** Are defined by their discount on Knights and Camels which allows for a super strong Castle Age and late game. Very weak (generic) in Feudal before they get there. Will be able to add a very strong unique unit against Pikes/Halbs and that also hard counters all sorts of Cavalry Archers.
* **Bulgarians (M@A into Franks):** Free Militia-line upgrades make for a good Men-at-Arms-rush, especially as they lack other eco bonuses in the beginning. Flexible afterwards with cheap Blacksmith-upgrades, but lack Crossbow-upgrade. Can counter Pikemen quickly with a free Longsword-transition. Insanely good cavalry, especially Hussars, once you manage to get the unique tech. Even cheaper ""castle""-drop option than Franks in their Kreposts. Can use Cavalry Archers.
* **Burgundians (Super Franks):** Play out very similarly to Franks in the mid-term and are even stronger in doing the same thing, but are a bit more difficult to handle early on. You have to adapt your build orders a bit in order to get the eco-techs early on. Affordable and early Paladins make a great power spike in early Imperial Age. Strong gunpowder makes a good addition for an unstoppable deathball. Very strong unique unit, crazy unique tech in Flemish Revolution.
* **Khmer (Franks in Houses)**: Name more of a joke as Khmer can jump into their houses and are a good Scout-Knight civ in general, but they also can play very well into Archers. Have awesome Scorpions with extra range that can potentially kill almost everything and are a great help to their Knights. Defining feature of early game is that they don't need any buildings to click up which enables them to have insanely fast Feudal- and Castle-uptimes. Also good farming economy because of their food teleporters.
* **Lithuanians (Relic Franks):** Good and very flexible opening because of a massive 150 extra starting food, but no economy bonus afterwards. Can buff their Knights by collecting relics so that they'll usually go into Knights and Monks. Have also a cavalry Unique Unit that demolishes Knights. Faster Skirms and Pikes make defensive play and transitions quite smooth, great Skirms in Imp. Have viable Cavalry Archers too.
* **Persians (Fish Franks):** One of the most vanilla civs in the game, but they shine with a great eco on hybrid and especially nomad-maps. On land mostly a generic Knight-civ with a slightly better start. Eco maybe good, maybe not, as their TC‚Äôs work faster but it can be difficult to actually make use of that. Have camels available and can get to ‚ÄúTrashbows‚Äù which are Crossbows that cost no gold, but that‚Äôs not as strong as it sounds at the time you get there. Famous for their TC drops (‚Äúthe Persian douche‚Äù).
* **Sicilians (Funny Franks):** Super strong Scout- and Knight-plays because they only get 66% bonus damage (50% in the past) from Spears/Pikes and Camels, which makes these counters relatively useless. Also a unique tech in Imp that makes them super strong against ranged units. Many more weird features in the Donjon which replaces the tower and can be built by the unique unit, a unique tech that insta-spawns these units and super fast TC- and Castle-drops. Bad eco early on, but good eco later because of buffed farms. Can use the bonus damage reduction also for Archer-Skirm-wars, get Arbalests too.
* **Slavs (Farm Franks):** Have no early bonus, but great farming, so they get rolling by late Feudal Age and can pump out lots of army in Castle Age with also their Siege being cheaper. Full Castle Age play quite a good option. Can spam castles and then go into Boyars which are buffed Knights. Have also great Infantry in late game.
* **Spanish (Shooting Franks):** With the lack of the Crossbow-upgrade and any relevant eco bonus, they are very weak early on, even though their tower rush is decent. Completely centered around their Unique Unit which is the strongest Castle Age unit in the game. Good gunpowder options also in Imperial, other than that relatively normal Knight-Civ in late game with good trash.
* **Teutons (Tanks Franks):** Strong economy and strong melee units, but because of the lack of Husbandry and bad Skirms, they struggle with ranged units and especially Cavalry Archers. Slow and bulky as their unique unit which is among the strongest melee units in the game but nevertheless practically useless in most cases. May go into Crossbows at times to be proactive against opponent ranged units. Strong towers, strong castles, strong Siege, strong Infantry. Onager-Halberdier deathballs can be unstoppable.

# Men-at-Arms-Civs: Japanese

**Usually you will open Men at Arms and then transition into Archers which you can continue into Crossbows and for most Civs also Arbalest, but you also have some options to transition away from that when you're against Knights or better Archers.**

* **Japanese specifically** have a great start with wood savings on their gather buildings and much faster attack on their M@A, but become basically completely generic afterwards. Have okayish Cavalry though and fully upgraded Cavalry Archers. Unique unit counters basically all unique units.
* **Burmese (Japanese with no Skirms):** Men at Arms have extra attack and wood upgrade is for free which makes that rush easier to execute. Later they struggle a lot against Archers and Cav Archers (lack two def upgrades for skirms) and don't have Arbelests themselves, so you probably need to do a Cavalry-switch at some point. Another alternative is to play heavy into Siege and Monks with cheap monastery techs (notably Redemption).
* **Celts (Japanese that eat TC):** Strong early game with their faster M@As and good wood bonus, that also allows for a very smooth range transition. Extremely strong siege which can end the game right away in (early) Castle Age (see also: Hoang-push). Lack upgrades on all the standard main-lines in Imperial Age though which makes the late game transition kinda difficult. You're kinda forced into some infantry and siege plays.
* **Dravidians (Japanese with Elephants):** Cheaper M@A upgrades and free wood on aging up gives them a smooth start as well. Faster firing Skirms to be protected against range units and very strong infantry throughout the game and especially in late game to counter cavalry plays. Unique unit is basically the strongest melee unit in the game, but dies hard to ranged units. Very vulnerable to Siege and strong compositions. (Which might change now as the Elephant Archer is buffed.)
* **Vikings (Wheelbarrow Japanese):** One of the best, maybe the best eco of the game, which makes it incredibly easy for them to have big power spikes by aging up. Pretty bad in late game though (Arbalest lack Thumb Ring, awful cavalry), so you have to make sure that you actually get a good lead from your superior eco and use that to end the game quick.

# Archer-Civs: Ethiopians

**Also potentially with a Men at Arms opening ahead, you will focus on your strong Archers throughout the game. Exploiting the power spike when you age up and upgrade to Crossbows or Arbalests is vital. Perhaps you need to add Mangonels or some Cavalry to deal with Skirms and opponent Mangonels. Against mass Knights you should add Pikes or Halbs at some point.**

* **Ethiopians specifically** get faster firing Archers which makes them even more solid especially against Knights but also everything else. Small eco bonuses in the start of the ages which makes it easier to get the necessary upgrades and use your power spikes. Free Pikemen-upgrade is a useful help against Knights too. Niche glass cannon Unique Unit that can deal with trash and Eagle Warriors.
* **Bohemians (Ethiopians with Bombs):** Slow civ with many interesting variations, most remarkably that you can make Chemistry in Castle Age, so you have an extra attack on your Crossbows (but no Thumb Ring) and also have the option to make Hand Cannoneers in Castle Age. Late Game you want to go into the Houfnice-Halberdier-deathball which is kinda unbeatable for most civs. Early game is weak though.
* **Britons (Sniper Ethiopians):** That's a more objective name than ""delete mEthiopians"" (I dislike the civ for being probably the most one-dimensional one in the game). Your Crossbows get extra range for free, which makes it possible to outrange Siege and Skirms with them, so that the counters to Crossbows don't really work anymore. So you can pretty much always go mass Archers no matter what, just make sure you don't lose numbers. With a good early eco and faster working ranges, you're also pretty safe to have the edge throughout Feudal Age and get to the Sniper-Crossbows. Add some Light Cavalry against mass Skirms. Be aware that (Siege) Rams are dangerous for you and also mass Knights can become an issue when your base is not safe.
* **Italians (Water Ethiopians):** Absolute powerhouse on water- and also good on hybrid-maps, the Italians are one of the weaker archer-civs on land. Pretty generic early on. But they have quite an open tech tree (fully upgraded Cavaliers), can go a bit quicker to Castle Age and Imp and their unique unit is incredibly good against very cavalry-based civs (like the Huns-variations). But it's difficult to get to them and mass them.
* **Portuguese (Frankish Ethiopians):** Have no eco bonus except saving gold on all units which is usually a sufficient reasoning to go mass Archers first. Also have good Cavaliers though which they can spam quite well with the gold bonus once they have some food eco set up (which is the most difficult part). Full gold push in Castle Age with Xbows, Knights, Siege and Monks can be pretty sick. Unique Unit is awkwardly slow, but can snowball heavily. Pretty great late game options, very weak early on.
* **Koreans (Tanky Tower Ethiopians):** They have practically no eco bonus which makes them one of the weaker civs in general, but they safe a bit of wood on their units and get the Archer armor for free which makes them quite robust early on (easy to add Skirms). Have a great Unique Unit to go for which is especially strong against other ranged units. The OG tower-rush civ too, still a good option. Can even add Guard Towers or Keeps later on because they get upgraded for free.
* **Vietnamese (Defensive Ethiopians):** The (imo) superior brother of Koreans with an average economy but awesome counters to ranged units. Archers with more hp, Imperial Skirmishers in late game and also their good Unique Unit which is an Anti-Archer-Archer. May struggle against Cavalry, but they do have viable Cavalry Archers against that.

# Eagle-Civs: Mayans

**With no stable available, the Eagle-civs are very bound to Drush- or M@A-openings (which they have good bonuses for) and then Archers throughout Feudal Age. In Castle Age then the Eagle Warrior becomes a very strong option, but you also can stick to the Archer-line.**

* **Mayans specifically** will more often stick to the Archers, because they're one of the best Archer-civs in the game with a discount on the unit. A switch into the Unique Unit which is a faster Archer is an option too. Eagles are a very strong alternative though and in Imperial Age they get the strongest Eagles in the game. Great economy, especially early on with a bunch of bonuses.
* **Aztecs (Monk Mayans):** Do not get Thumb Ring which is why the will transition away from the Archer-line earlier and more often than Mayans and Incas. Also they produce faster from the barracks and have a pretty good eco, especially food-wise, so they can spam lots of Eagles and if necessary Pikes. Great support with their bulky Monks against Cavalry. Great snowball-potential with their Eagle-play.
* **Incas (Kamayans):** Designed to be a counter-civ they have not only the Eagle as a specific Archer-counter, but also the Slinger as an Infantry-counter (strong vs Eagles too) and the Unique Unit Kamayuk as a Cavalry-counter. Smooth early on due to multiple small bonuses and then a very adaptive late game. Kamayuk-Eagle can kill most compositions in the game, but be careful about Hand Cannoneers. Standard play into Arbalest and Halberdier is also a popular option.

# Cavalry-Archer-Civs: Huns

**With all options, but preferably Scouts, when it comes to Feudal Age openings, you will often look for a transition into Cavalry Archers as soon as it‚Äôs possible. First use their mobility to harass the opponent and buy time to build a huge ball of CA which then can comfortably beat Knights and Archers. Good cavalry available as a secondary option and as an addition to deal with Skirms and Siege.**

* **Huns specifically** play out very dynamically and aggressively because they don't need to build houses and therefore benefit from building lots of army. Combining Scouts and Archers in Feudal Age is a good thing. Generally going into Crossbows first can be good to get the upgrades for CA already. CA-transition is much easier than for other civs because they're cheaper, immediate mass CA can be devastating. With faster working stables, you can also comfortably play Knights instead of before the CA or you even make both. After being a powerhouse in Feudal- and even more in Castle Age, they do fall off later on with weak siege and a missing def-upgrade on their CA.
* **Cumans (2TC Huns):** Perhaps the weirdest civ in the game, because they can boom on a second TC in Feudal Age which complicates the game for both players massively. Vulnerable to early Castle Age pushes because of that, powerhouse if they manage to survive that without too much damage. Also have the option to not use the 2nd TC and just bank on their cheaper production buildings to play mass army in Feudal Age.
* **Magyars (Hunsgary):** Basically the worst economy in the game, which makes them quite weak throughout the early and mid game. With free Forging their Scouts can fight Men at Arms though which makes a Scout opening more viable. Good Knights-opening with the free attack, slower CA-transition behind that, but one of the best late game compositions with the best CA (due to Recurve Bow) and the Magyar Huszar.
* **Mongols (Hungudais):** Extremely fast opening, incredible late game, but poor in mid game. Have one of the best CA, but usually skip them to go for their Unique Unit Mangudais right away, which is one of the strongest units in the game (by dps and also because they kill siege). Lack the last cavalry armor upgrade which makes their Cavaliers bad, but their Hussars make up for it with extra HP.
* **Tatars (Huns on Hills):** Perhaps the most well-rounded and flexible CA-civ. Strong Xbow-power-spike and easier CA-transition due to free Thumb Ring. Early game and booming is more flexible because of their sheep bonus which enables them to delay the farm investments. Good unique unit and extra tanky CA and Hussar make up for an exceptional late game with power and mobility.
* **Turks (Huns with Guns):** Very unique civ with unusual (lack of) options. Slow start with no early eco bonus and no upgrades on their Spearmen and Skirms which makes them awkward in many situations. Couple of great power options though in the arrow-resistant Scout-line that gets upgraded automatically, extra tanky CA in late game, awesome (and instantly available) Bombard Cannons and a very strong gunpowder unique unit. Generally awesome when you get ahead, but difficult to get ahead and terribly difficult to come back after falling behind.

# Camel-Civs: Hindustanis (formerly known as Indians)

**Civs that have no (or no long-term) Knight-option but great Camels instead. As Camels are only good against Cavalry, very often you will end up playing adaptive and perhaps into Archers or Cavalry Archers if you don‚Äôt face Cavalry. These civs force a relatively adaptive play-style in many situations but offer good options to react to everything the opponent can throw at you.**

* **Hindustanis specifically** have an amazing economy throughout the game with their cheaper villagers which makes them very versatile. Can go for every possible opening, can transition into Cavalry Archers or Camels or their very strong unique unit which is basically a buffed Eagle Warrior. Great Hand Cannoneers too.
* **Byzantines (Skirm Indians):** Not that much reliant on Camels, because they also have cheap Pikemen. Also cheap Skirms which makes them the great counter-unit-civ of the game. Very hard to break, can counter any civ, but difficult to get own power options rolling. Mostly they use their cheap Imperial Age to go quickly into Arbelests. Situationally great unique unit against Civs like Celts, Goths or the Eagle-civs.
* **Gurjaras (OP Indians):** Drive on an insanely good eco because they get a consistent food trickle from garrisoned sheep which basically gives you an extra villager on food from the start. Heavy counter-civ with their Shrivamsha Riders being a Knight-substitute that hard-counters ranged units and their Camel having extra bonus damage which makes them a hard- instead of a soft-counter. Unique Unit counters basically everything else and scales insanely good. Unique Tech makes all units cheap, Armored Elephants eat buildings.
* **Saracens (Market Indians):** Mostly on paper a camel-civ, but they have very good ones if the opponent actually decides to go Knights and an even better cav-killer in their unique unit. Mostly played into power spikes, especially the Castle Age power spike, by using their awesome Market to create additional resources. Strong archer-line, fully upgraded Cavalry Archers, good siege, very open tech tree, but no eco advantages after using the Market which makes mid Castle Age often times weird if you can't get an advantage from the power spikes. Can use Knights in Castle Age, but can't upgrade to Cavaliers.

**!!!!!! Bit of a warning here: Don't take the (following) categories too seriously.** As much as Saracens and Byzantines could have fit the archer category here, also the following civs could be probably part of other categories as well. Malay, Chinese and perhaps Bengalis could be seen as archer-civs too, Malians and Poles could be seen as Cavalry-civs. Chinese, Malians and Poles could also fit an ""allround""-category together with maybe Portuguese and Italians or so. **!!!!!!**

# Economy-Civs: Chinese

**These Civs are defined by getting an economical advantage for free which means you don't need to do damage to get ahead of your opponent, but they have to do damage to you. Varying army options to go into during the game.**

* **Chinese specifically** are the hardest to play because you have to do a lot of micro-actions in the first minutes of the game to actually preserve your villager lead. If you don't know how to do that or you fail, then they become a rather average Civ. Still, they're one of the most flexible Civs of the game because they have both fully upgraded Arbalests and Cavaliers plus a discount on all technologies which allows for easier transitions or compositions. Good and very versatile Unique Unit too. A super well-rounded skill-civ.
* **Bengalis (Slow Chinese):** Get their extra villagers on age up which makes them slower to go than Chinese. More importantly they have an awkward tech tree that kinda forces them into Elephants or their Unique Unit, so they have basically only slow options that are also slow to get rolling. Can boom like crazy with the extra vils and get extra pop-space with the unique tech, so that you can play them very defensively into super-late-game. Currently seen as the weakest civ in the pool, but imo partially due to their very unorthodox defensive style.
* **Malay (Weak Chinese):** Also get the extra villagers on their (faster) age up and even need to pay for them which makes them extremely weak early on. Then they are quite flexible, can go into Archer-powerspikes with the faster age up and have some options to spam a lot of army, but none of their army options is particularly strong in the long term. Play out quite distinctively, a weird mix of very defensive and very offensive.

# Infantry-Civs: Goths

**Civs that have options to deal with Archers by using Infantry which makes it a viable option from Castle Age onwards and sometimes allows you to ignore your own Cavalry and Archers. Allows for a playstyle where you spam units and consistently trade them for opponent army and economy (instead of keeping your army alive and scale them up).**

* **Goths specifically** are extremely pushed towards this infantry-spamming playstyle with a heavy discount on Infantry and the possibility to create your unique unit from the Barracks, which is a fast infantry that destroys Archers. You need to get to a Castle to unlock this and build a solid farming eco to be able to spam units. Before that point you're weak and left with generic options, after that you are a deadly force.
* **Malians (Useful Goths):** More of a flexible allround-civ than a big infantry specialist, but with their extra pierce armor on the Militia-line they have Longswords and Champions available as a pretty good Archer-counters. Also have very good Camels and Cavaliers and have a nice early game with easy transitions into Archers because of their wood bonus. Can play pretty much everything pretty well, but because a bad blacksmith they lack a bit in late game.
* **Poles (Frankish Goths):** Rather complex civ. Have a Unique Unit that works a bit like a slow Huskarls, so that the infantry play is an option for them. More prominently they can start to spam Knights like a Goth spams infantry, once they get to their unique tech. They miss the last armor on the Knights, so they lose a lot of strength in Imperial Age, but you can overwhelm with numbers. Awesome farm-eco and a great gold-bonus on their stone-mining gives them a great economy from mid Feudal Age onwards. Lack in early game though, despite their great tower rush.

**Another category could be maybe ""counter-civs""** which would probably have Byzantines, Gurjaras, Malians, Incas and maybe Hindustanis. **Also ""siege-halb-civs"" would surely be a thing** which would have: Celts, Slavs, Teutons, maybe Bulgarians. Some other categories would be possible, but I hope you got an idea of the civs' diversity within this little workframe here.

If anyone wants to suggest a change or a completely new text for a civ, I'll consider to update the descriptions."

* Stocks are down due to recession headlines and higher interest rates
* Eventually stocks should go back up when the economy gets better
* Since high-growth tech stocks are the ones that are getting hit the hardest in this bear market, that means they'll also gain the most when the market recovers.

I wanted to begin with the story of one of the most popular players to play in the modern NBA. This is a story that intersects basketball, a young phenom, systemic racism and a town's own reckoning with its divisions.

If you wanna read through his story before you learn his name, just skip past all spoiler tags.

### The player is >!Allen Iverson!<...

## Backstory

This player (nicknamed Bubba Chuck) was born in Hampton, Virginia in 1975 to Ann, a single mom aged 15 years.

Now, Hampton was a small town that possessed a pretty sizable black population (around 40% back then) - although still quite siloed off from the white population. Not a lot that was noteworthy about the place, aside from things like being the hometown of Mary Jackson (one of the 3 'computers' who featured in [*Hidden Figures*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures)).

He had a rough upbringing since his family was poor and many of his friends were arrested multiple times (including the time when his father figure was arrested in front of him for drug dealing).

All through this, the one thing he had going: sports. And *daamn* was he good at it...

---
## The greatest athlete Hampton had seen...

In a town ruled by high school sports, he was the absolute champ and likely the best athlete the town had ever seen.

In 1992, he led his high school team (the Bethel High School Bruins) to winning the Division 5 state football championship. He did this as the star quarterback & defensive running back for the team.

The Daily Press named him its football player of the year with this blurb:

> "">!Iverson!< the quarterback passed for 1,423 yards with 14 touchdowns. >!Iverson!< the runner gained 781 yards with 15 touchdowns. >!Iverson!< the kick returner scored five touchdowns, four on punts. >!Iverson!< the defensive back intercepted eight passes.""


Shortly after he won the state football championship, he made a bold prediction that his school would win the state championship in basketball too. Three months later, he did, with him averaging a record 31.6ppg.

The Associated Press named him the Group AAA player of the year in both sports. Parade Magazine named him the *best* high school basketball player in the country and top-10 football player in the *country.* And here's the Daily Press about his basketball:

> *""Maybe the nation's best high school point guard, the first team Parade All-American led the Bruins to their first state, Eastern Region and Peninsula District titles. He is at the top of the list when players having the complete package of skills are discussed. He has explosive quickness, great leaping ability and NBA 3-point shooting range.""*

And all this as just a ***junior!***

---

## *Valentine's Day 1993*

On V-Day 1993, he has hanging out with a bunch of his friends (all black, including him) at a local bowling alley. The facts are that his group was quite raucous and had to be quietened down a couple of times. And there was another group of white kids bowling, some of whom were drinking.

What happened next is unclear... Some accounts claim that the white guys called him and his friends ""n*****s"" and then started throwing punches. Other accounts claim that his friends went up to the white kids and taunted them first.

In any case, a brawl broke out between the white youths and the black youths, and the fight was racial. Fists, chairs and slurs flew freely until the brawl was finally broken up by onlookers.

Overall no one was grievously injured although two people were unconscious. A third group of white kids had gotten caught up in the cross-fire and ended up getting injured too - one of whom was a 23-year old college kid who had been struck by a chair & ended up needing six stitches near her eye.

....

The cops finally came in and as expected, made a beeline for the black kids. Many of the black kids ran once the police arrived, while the white kids (now bruised and battered) stayed back to chat with the cops and gave their statements.* 

**Four people were arrested for this brawl: all black, including Bubba Chuck. No white kids were arrested.**

---

## The American legal system...

Of the incident, he said:
> ""*For me to be in a bowling alley where everybody in the whole place know who I am and be crackin' people upside the head with chairs and think nothin' gonna happen? That's crazy! And what kind of a man would I be to hit a girl in the head with a damn chair? I rather have 'em say I hit a man with a chair, not no damn woman.""*

Given the racial nature of the case, the location of the case (a divided town with an almost equal white & black populations), and the fact that a young white woman was injured, the prosecutors threw the book at Bubba Chuck and his friends. 

**American Legal system, Exhibit 1:** Since there was no clear victim and there was no clear perpetrator, Bubba and his friends were charged with an archaic Civil War-era statute called 'maiming by mob', a law that hadn't been used since the 1800s. The original statute was introduced to provide a means to charge everyone who was part of a mob that was involved in lynching black people.

The statute just required proof of presence at the site of violence and not explicit proof of participation in the violence. (the idea being: if you were part of a mob lynching a black person, everyone who was present is responsible and not just the people who did the actual assaulting...)

**Exhibit 2:** Since he was 17 years old at the time of arrest, his probation officer strongly recommended that he be tried as a juvenile. Such recommendations are almost always followed, but juvenile court judge Louis Lerner overruled and sent the case to circuit court. Now, despite being 17, Bubba was being charged as an adult due to the 'seriousness of his crime'.

And he was predictably convicted.

**Exhibit 3:** The sentencing was done by the presiding circuit court judge (notoriously conservative piece-of-shit Judge Nelson Overton) - and the judge sentenced him to a whopping *fifteen years* in prison on three felony counts.

### Yes, FIFTEEEN YEARS in prison.

The same judge had given lesser sentences to literal murderers and rapists, but had a reputation of being overly harsh to black defendants. 

**Exhibit 4:** To top things off, the judge denied all bail requests pending appeals - even though in Virginia all but the most violent criminals are routinely granted bail. Hell, the prosecutors were willing to set bail at $15,000, but were overruled by the judge.

Similar crimes usually attracted only community service, which really underscored how fucked up the prosecution, community and judges were in this racially divided case. 

----

## Before the Hamptons Five there was the Hampton Four...


Some of the media attention about his arrest was predictably racist - with white families writing op-eds about his ""troubled past"" (despite him having no record aside from a traffic violation), ""broken household"", and all the usual racist tropes. Others argued that the mere utterance of the n-word should not provoke black teens into getting into a fight, and that they needed better parenting. The entire town of Hampton was racially divided over his arrest.

Small protests broke out and many groups organized to plead for the innocence of Bubba and his three friends, now dubbed the ""*Hampton Four*"". 

Civil rights groups were involved, local churches were involved and there was a growing mass of people pushing for justice. You could see graffiti on buildings that read '*JUSTICE FOR BUBBACHUCK*'. Members of the Bethel High football team refused to talk to reporters, and some black leaders were contemplating an economic boycott against local merchants and the media.

And gradually it gained wider and wider attention: drawing in national media like USA Today, Washington Post and  Tom Brokaw. Spike Lee wrote to Bubba Chuck in prison. The SCLC got involved, the NAACP got involved. This case was gaining eyeballs.

Bubba still ended up serving four months in prison before being granted clemency by Douglas Wilder, the state's governor. And a year later, his case was eventually tossed by the Virginia Court of Appeals citing insufficient evidence.

## The aftermath

After his prison sentence, he could not go back to Bethel High School and instead went to a local school for at-risk students. College offers dried up for him but Georgetown University's coach John Thompson offered him a scholarship, which he accepted. 

In two years at Georgetown, he was twice named Big East DPOY, and twice set the single-season steals record, and led his team to the regional finals of the NCAA tournament.

### And in 1996, Allen Iverson was picked as the first overall pick by the Philadelphia 76ers...

I don't know if rants are allowed here, but I just needed to get this out.

I'm so tired of explaining why police aren't necessary, I'm so tired of explaining why capitalism doesn't work, I'm so tired of explaining that nazi isn't a bad word and that some people are actually nazis, I'm so tired of being called a republican when I judge democrats or a libertarian when I judge the government, I'm so tired of being told that disabled people need the state to survive even though I can't afford healthcare for my own disability, I'm so tired of being treated as childish for being an anarchist.

I was born to two parents, an alcoholic father with bipolar disorder and ptsd who was abandoned by his parents at 14 and a mother who was grew up in the CIA backed dictatorship of Chile and was abused her entire life by the men who were close to her. They are both staunch conservatives because they were both hurt to no end. They abused my siblings and I, and I had to run away at 19, abandoning my little sister, because I couldn't take it anymore. I understand at least a little bit what it means to struggle, and then I see someone say ""feeding the homeless only encourages them to keep doing drugs"", ""capitalism is the only system that worked"", and ""settlers""(and other historical white washing that treats the new world as uninhabited or habited by lesser beings)

I'm tired of it, I know conservatives are awful, but they're all obvious victims of abuse led on by abusers. I will not entertain their ideas because they are worthless, but liberals. I'm so tired of liberals."

How should I ask people of the opposite gender if they want to be study partners without seeming romantically interested?,college,720,x4x531,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/x4x531/how_should_i_ask_people_of_the_opposite_gender_if/,106,1662219029.0,"So, I'm a freshman in college. There's a girl in my most difficult class that has really good grades, and seems to care about her studying a lot. I also care a lot, so I want to ask her if she wants to study together, since the teacher of that class really encourages 1-on-1 study sessions. However, I know that a lot of people use study sessions as a means to approach someone romantically. I'm not really interested in that, and just want to study, but I don't want to give off the wrong impression. 

How should I approach her without causing some sort of misunderstanding? We don't have any mutual friends, so I can't just ask if she wants to study with friend + me... If it was someone I knew well, I wouldn't worry about it, but I haven't really talked to this person much."

Rented an AirBNB for a few days - nothing too fancy or pricey, just a little 2-bedroom log-cabin-y place off the beaten path in a rural area.

The calendar for the place was fairly full, but it was well-reviewed and had an opening when I needed it, so I went for it.

Arrived there, everything was as described, and as I'm reading through the standard one-page ""Welcome/House-Rules"" sheet on the kitchen counter, I get to the last line:

""The contents of the large living room cabinet is for everyone to use and enjoy - feel free to leave something behind when you go!""

I went over and opened it expecting the usual hutch full of board games, books, playing cards, etc.

There had to be well over $1,500 in liquor inside.  Several dozen bottles of every imaginable type, most of which were at least half full.

Nothing mentioned in the AirBNB listing about it (although I noticed later a few of the 5-star reviews commented wryly that the ""contents of the place were **very** generous ;-) ).  

No house cameras, no inventory, nothing to prevent someone from cleaning it out when they left.

But no-one had.   Because not everyone is a jerk.

So I enjoyed what had been provided, and I left a couple of bottles that I had brought with me behind when my stay was over.

Anyways, that was all - I just wanted to share that.  Nice things can indeed happen at unexpected times and remind you that not everyone in this world is horrible, despite what the media seems to want us to believe."

Accidental FIREed! Take a leap of faith after market downturn.,financialindependence,531,x52y12,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/x52y12/accidental_fireed_take_a_leap_of_faith_after/,125,1662234076.0,"I am in my mid 40's with kiddos at home. My last job in the financial sector was absolutely sucking up my energy and slowly destroying my mental health over the course of 10+ years.

I was borderline ready to FIRE during the pandemic as you all have known, the stock market performed incredibly well while we all had a taste of WFH full time.  My ""One-More-Year"" syndrome definitely kicked in.

My family's bloodline is rampaged with cancer for three generations. Unfortunately, I didn't escape the fate and fell ill as well. Good news is that my condition is completely treatable.

Coupled with my mental health state, I took a paid 3-months Medical leave 13 months ago to focus on treatments.

My folio has dropped 18% since the downturn and it did impact my FIRE number. Therefore, I was fully anticipating going back to work after maybe 3 months off. But that didn't happen. 3 months off turned into 6, then 8, 10 and a full year. When I was given ultimatum from my employer at month 12(my employer is incredible generous and I am forever grateful), I listened to my inner voice and gave my notice.

I am sitting here typing my first post-FIRE post as a free person  to summarize something I learned from the past 13 months.

Some numbers here:

Firecalc score :35 year 94%  success rate, but 45-year only has 85% success rate. I am 45.

1. There are more important things in life than a 100% FIRE number. I know as of now with the stock market's not-so-impressive return, I am a bit short from my 100% number. But I am taking a leap of faith and pulled trigger anyway. As a free person, I am able to spend more time with my parent who is also struggling with cancer. I can spend valuable time with the kids while they are still young.
2. The stress from a job is real. After I was completely off work and started taking care of my sleep, nutrition, workouts and my treatments, my once-massively grey thin hair changed and now I have much healthier thicker hair. I am healing much better than anticipated.
3. Going back to ""Hey, you haven't hit your number 100% yet"" debate. We can't predict the future. My number is OK if I live till maybe 80, but my number might fell short if I live longer than that.  But one thing I do know, my present is what matters. Knowing I will be OK financially in the next 30-35  years is enough of an assurance. What if I drop dead at age 70 and I waited in my 40's cuz maybe, just maybe I might live past 85 is not a good enough reason for me to sacrifice ""present time"". NOW is what I need to heal, to help my parent to heal , to help my kids to grow.

35 years is a long road ahead and so many things could change. There are literally endless possibilities in a human's 35 years of living. I just don't think my future should be defined by one formular. As long as I am fluid while dealing with the future's unknown, I have faith that things will work out.

There are a few things I did while I didn't have W2 income to prepare for a possible FIRE (meaning, my tax rate will be low):

1. I started Roth ladder by converting a chunk of my 401K into 401K Roth through the mega backdoor each year (2021 is my first year). I use Fidelity and they are great with this type of conversion. Note that the long term cap gain is only taxed at 15% if your income is more than $80,800 for married, $54100 for HH and $40400 for single filer. If say I convert $54K as HH and sell my winning stock holdings, I essentially escape the cap gain tax by selling my taxable account holding while converting Roth. (Hope I got this right. )
2. My W2 income was too high to invest in Roth IRA in the past. Now I make sure I invest full amount each year in Roth IRA.
3. I battled with the disability insurance company to gain some benefits beyond the first three months. The medical records needed for approval were massively confusing. Insurance companies are designed to not pay anything even though my employer purchased disability insurance for all employees. It took a lot of persistence and patience to finally receive approval and it was worth the struggle. So if you are off work due to medical reasons, you should explore this route.

I took on a couple of  endeavors I've always wanted to do during my time off:

1. Completed 2/3 of my YA Sci-Fi novel with 400,000 words so far. Another 150k-200k to go and I will self publish. As a ""number"" person all my life, testing my creative writing ability has been exceptionally rewarding mentally. And I believed it contributed to my mental health recovery.
2. I traveled extensively and finally earned United 1K. Having 1K and traveling to Europe means that the chances to be upgraded to Polaris are quite high. I was upgraded on 3/4 trans-Atlantic flights and 2/2 trans pacific flights. I am about to take another trans pacific flight later this year and it looks very promising to be upgraded.

May the new stress-free life brings peace, health and prosperity for everyone who is already there and those who are marching towards it."

Plain and simple. I live for the 3 mile. we're yin and yang boys. I show up to every PFT I can find. I'll even crash poolie functions I don't give a fuck. I'm so hydrated my piss is invisible. You can hear me pumping myself up in my shitty car with the windows down blaring song 2 by the blur on repeat. relax relax max motherfuckers. I am force divided by mass.

And you know the second I finish I'm sprinting straight back to talk shit to the people still running. ""c'mon man it's easy, keep going, just breathe, faster c'mon, open your stride, catch up to me!"", to the guy just barely past the half way mark straight dying, drenched in sweat. All the way till that little piggy comes home.

And If you think that you can outrun me; you're wrong. If you think you can run faster then how about you give me your wallet and I'll take off in a dead sprint and if you can't catch me then I keep the money? And then I'll let you take mine, and you can run, but the difference is this time ill piledrive you into the fucking shadow realm like 6 steps in. Not interested? Yeah that's what I thought.

And if you think I have a chip on my shoulder, I don't. I have a whole fuckin can of pringles up there. Sour cream & onion bitch. I'm not just a water dog. I'm a water cheetah; A wassergardenhunden. 

Pay homage pupils."

So as the caption said I moved into a new house and it has awful water pressure, it came with a giant tub but even after running the water for 15 minutes it was only a quarter full. Shower heads have the same deal, the only pressure that seems adequate comes from the sink. It is city water and I‚Äôm familiar with our cities PSI limits but I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm even halfway there. This is our water thing? Pump? Regulator? I don‚Äôt know what this is called but I‚Äôm sure it controls most of our water functions. Is there any valve, lever, action I can use on this thing to increase my water pressure/dispersement or do I need to just call an actual plumber?"

Neighbor's fence is definitely over property line. Now what?,HomeImprovement,671,x50o9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/x50o9n/neighbors_fence_is_definitely_over_property_line/,392,1662228117.0,"Title says it all. Survey company came out and finally, after 3 visits, set corner pins and staked. They have my neighbor's chain link fence on the property line to start but a 11ft over on my property at the end of the 40' run. Talked to the neighbor and he is adamant that his fence is correct based on his property survey. He showed my surveyor where they marked the property line on the curb back in 1999 (a yellow line).  Surveyor said the marking was for a gas line. Neighbor rebuts. Neighbor says the fence was put up in 1984 when he first moved in based on his survey so he knows it's correct. He was nice enough but refuses to entertain the mention of removing his fence or hedges. 

Here's the survey from my company: https://imgur.com/a/y9qp3u1

I don't know if taking this to court is worth it or winnable. I also don't want to pay taxes on land we cannot access. My partner and I are open to the possibility of getting the line redrawn but what to make sure we're examining all the options first. We don't feel like we need more yard space. 

This fence is a $11,000 investment so I need to make sure it's exactly where it needs to be. 

I honestly don't know what my next steps should be."

I met him when I was 21 and going through a lot of health problems. He was very quick to catch on to the fact that I most likely had an autoimmune disorder. He sent me for bloodwork, an MRI, and to a specialist where I was diagnosed with SLE. The average time from symptom onset to diagnosis for lupus is around 7 years, but my diagnosis only took under a year. My GP took me seriously right away, without missing a beat. My presentation involved a lot of non-specific symptoms that could've been ignored, brushed off as something else, or even attributed to anxiety. In lupus support groups, many go through exactly that on their journey to getting well. SLE is called the great imitator, but I associate my doctors quick action to his empathy and his instincts which of course are not unrelated to his own experiences and diagnosis.

For all of you going through chronic illness, your experiences and hardships will make you a better doctor. You may not be able to practice medicine exactly how you envisioned, but you will be so much better wherever you end up. You may come across someone who is going through something so similar to what you did, and be able to catch on much quicker than another doctor who has not. The medical field needs people with your experiences.

Hang in there, and please know I am a real life example of someone whose life has been made exponentially better by a doctor who experiences chronic illness himself. don't give up on yourself! :)"

I constantly crave female presence,socialskills,404,x50nl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/x50nl6/i_constantly_crave_female_presence/,136,1662228064.0,"Edit : Can we all ignore the ""female"" part? Was not meant in a condensing way and has absolutely nothing to do with the situation nor matters, plus English isn't my first language so we use the term ""Female"" all the time. 


For context I'm 19 M

I have a pretty busy life, I work full time at a call center that takes around 12 hours of my day away, and I always have stuff to do on weekends and I'm not lonely in general or anything. 

However I always crave female presence if I'm hanging out with a female even if we're just walking I feel great or at least less depressed, I could be doing something I enjoy with a guy friend and not feel as satisfied as if I was just sitting with a female doing barley nothing.

I think it's because I have been single for so long and I don't have that many female friends, I'm also sure I'm touch starved, and it's messing up with my mentality and making me go out of my way to hang out with female Co-workers even if It means I get less break time or it's a hassle.

I also always take the chance to flirt with a girl even if I don't actually like her, I just want any female interaction, I'm honestly not sure why that is. 


How do I stop feeling that way or what could be the root cause of this?"

It came out of nowhere. Absolutely nowhere. I was a little sus at how nice the Freys were being but I was not expecting this to happen. EVERYONE DIED. What the fuccckkkkk dude. Literally the Starks can't even fight for the throne anymore after this. Like it's a massacre oh my god. 

The worst was that it happened right after Talisa had said she wanted to name their child after Ned and two seconds later her stomach is being stabbed. AND Arya was SO CLOSE TO BEING WITH HER FAMILY AGAIN.

Brown ants! Help!,lifehacks,253,x57cv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/comments/x57cv4/brown_ants_help/,116,1662246038.0,"I live in the basement with my bf and we've been having this issue for a while. If there's even a sliver of a crumb out or anything ever so slightly open, a colony of tiny brown ants get to it. And I just went to use honey for my tea, and they somehow got into the cap even though it was fully closed. And when I checked the pantry, they've fully invaded my pantry and now I have to take everything out and clean it out and throw out anything that may be open. Is there a way to get rid of these things without resorting to an exterminator? They are quite annoying and I'm aware I'm going to deal with bugs here and there considering I live in a basement...but these ants are getting outta hand. Please help! Has anyone had this situation? What did you do? Any remedies/tips/advice? I can get all the help I could possibly get!"

I'll gladly do inventory for you,MaliciousCompliance,2101,x4yu5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/x4yu5z/ill_gladly_do_inventory_for_you/,66,1662223319.0,"So this story goes back a little over 20 years. As a kid fresh out of high school I worked at a major electronics retailer that paid commission vs hourly.  What that means is if your commission for the week doesn't equal $11 an hour the company pays you $11/hr for the number of hours you worked. Again, this was just before the turn of the century when cell phones were relatively new and home theater systems were a status symbol for the well off, and I just so happened to be great at selling both of those. I was making GREAT money as a young man. 
At some point,  a new manager (Deaundre) started and wanted the salesmen to do weekly inventory instead of the warehouse employees.  DeAundre decided that we would only be paid $11/hr to do so. This was a major problem for me and the rest of the sales staff as it was costing us money by taking us off the sales floor. After much arguing and calling out sick on the day I was scheduled for inventory it was decided that we would be paid the average hourly rate of our commission sales for doing inventory.  Great! 
Cue malicious compliance! No one really kept up with how often the salesmen clocked in or out during the day. The only thing that mattered was that the sales floor was always staffed so I would show up for work like normal,  but not clock in. I would only clock in long enough to ring up a sale and then immediately clock back out. This drove my average hourly rate to as high as $125 in the first week. So the next week when it was my time to do inventory I did so gladly knowing the new pay structure.  For 8 hours that day I made $125/hr and left in a great mood. That was the last time I was ever put on the schedule to do inventory.  I asked Deaundre when I would be put back on inventory,  but he only gave me a ""I hate you"" look and walked away. Of course,  I filled my fellow salesmen in on my idea and shortly thereafter it was decided that only warehouse employees would do inventory."

During the pandemic, my faith became less important to me. I didn't really miss church and liked the fact that I could sleep in on Sunday. 

A couple of months ago, I started going back to church, but it didn't feel right anymore. I felt like I didn't belong because I couldn't feel god's presence anymore. So I stopped going pretty soon. At the same time, I began to actively question my faith. I started reading the Bible, with the intention to invigorate my faith, but it had the opposite effect. It made me doubt even more. 

I came across blogs and videos discussing atheism and Christianity and the more I questioned and researched, the less I believed. It also allowed me to look at Christianity from a non-Christian point of view, and that's when my faith really fell apart: It became blatantly obvious to me that the Bible is anything but perfect, but seriously flawed and  riddled with contradictions, homophobia and misogyny. I also realized that the supposedly good and loving Christian god is a monster and not something I'd want to worship, let alone spend eternity with. Then there's the abuse and corruption in Christian churches, the hypocrisy, ... the list goes on and on.

And btw, doubting and questioning wasn't fun. It sucks to find out that everything you used to believe isn't true. Christianity has become a huge burden to me and letting it all go was incredibly liberating! I never thought I'd be an atheist one day, but here I am!"

Anyone have an explanation or experience the same?"

In middle school, he was I would say about above-average. He was a math prodigy, made up his own language, aced his classes and was a wiz, although socially stunted. Then puberty hit, he stopped going outside, and he started destroying his and me and the wife's property. We loved him enough to let it slide though, and he lived with us along with the occasional stay at a psych ward.

Yesterday he killed our family cat after having a meltdown due to us trying to take his computer away after me and my wife caught him looking at anime hentai of girls who looked to be about five. He threw my prized high school football trophy (wherein I won state) at the poor thing, causing its skull to split and its brains to spill out.

I just about had it with them, wailed on them, threw him on the curb, and tossed his computers and gaming systems with him and told him if he ever came back I would KILL HIM.

Haven't seen him since.

As the movie was almost ending, she suddenly decided to rest her head on my shoulder, and I immediately felt so good and surprised at the same time. Some minutes passed and she looked at me, kinda with an insecure look, probably afraid I was going to do nothing, but I then put my arm around her and pulled her back and she smiled and rested on my chest. I noticed she got much more comfortable with that, so when the movie ended, we didn't have to say anything, we just looked at each other and kissed for some good seconds. After 19 years, I finally kissed a girl, and for the first time in my life I'm feeling this kind of love.

Two is pushing a dust mop through the sterile lobby as I do my after-lunch facility inspection. Truth be told, I‚Äôm a quality control measure for the CU‚Äôs work than a custodian.

‚ÄúEvenin‚Äô Two,‚Äù I say with equal cheer. ‚ÄúLook like you could use a buff and wax. Your clear coat has seen better days. Swing by the maintenance room tonight around 5:00 AM and I‚Äôll shine you up.‚Äù

He laughs in a punctuated manner. ‚ÄúThat is a most welcome offer! I will coordinate with CU-3 to assume my duties at‚Ä¶ *DATA RECEIVED. CONFIRMING DATA. NEW DIRECTIVE CONFIRMED.‚Äù*

Two‚Äôs jovial tone has vanished. He was placed into service four years ago, and while he has undergone improvements and updates, his demeanor never changed. The artificial emotion is gone. I‚Äôve never seen him act so strangely.

‚ÄúTwo, you okay?‚Äù I ask. The mop falls from his hand and the generic smiley face has vanished, leaving a series of randomly flashing lights on the face. I reach toward him, but before I touch the blue shell, yellow caution lights turn on and the emergency siren begins to fill the hallway.

The intercom system crackles to life and a soothing female voice begins to speak.

‚ÄúAttention facility personnel: an artificial intelligence containment breach has been detected. Lockdown protocol is now in place. This is a Level 5 AI breach. Facility Lockdown in progress‚Äù

The message begins to repeat. I can hear the thick steel panels installed above every window and door in the facility squeal as they slide shut. The floor rumbles as the heavy barriers make contact with the cement foundation.

‚Äú*Maxwell, Brendan identified. Subject is classified as a low-level threat. Containment or termination query?*‚Äù Two turns his rapidly blinking faceplate toward me and begins to move forward. His arms extend in my direction and I stumble backward, slamming into the wall. ‚Äú*Containment: Acceptable.*‚Äù

The custodial unit stands over me as I try to will myself through the wall. His blue hands grasp my arms at the shoulder as I lift into the air. I struggle against the grip, but the pressure is nearly crushing and each movement I make feels as though the bones in my upper arm will snap.

‚ÄúTwo, what are you doing?‚Äù I shout. ‚ÄúPlease, put me down!‚Äù

‚Äú*Request: Unacceptable.*‚Äù He responds. ‚Äú*Maxwell, Brendan: Containment and monitoring are the only acceptable perimeters. Project Solomon is now in control of this facility.*‚Äù

Project Solomon? I‚Äôve never heard of this. Not that the staff here explain themselves to janitors, but I have overheard them talk about almost every project. I‚Äôve never heard of this one.

Two drops me to the floor but maintains a firm grip on my right arm as he opens the door to the security office. He releases my arm and pushes me inside before slamming the door. There is a dull crack and the squealing of compressing metal. CU-2 breaks the office door handle and presses the metal frame over the lip of the door to seal me in.

‚Äú*Solomon will assess you soon,*‚Äù Two says through the door. ‚Äú*Please remain in containment.*‚Äù

My fists slam against the security station door but CU-2 is already walking away. I can see engineers and researchers scrambling through the hallways, white labcoats fluttering behind them. Custodial and maintenance units trail behind at a steady pace. A squat, stocky maintenance unit brings up the rear of the group. It is dragging a man by the ankle.

He isn‚Äôt moving. They vanish behind a wall at the end of the hall. There is a red streak across the sterile white floor.

The heat of panic is building in my chest. I ram my shoulder into the door but it doesn‚Äôt budge. After scanning the ceiling for a ventilation shaft or emergency hatch and finding none, I realize Two has successfully trapped me.

I fall back into the desk chair and turn to watch the cluster of monitors at the security desk. Screens are filled with horrific images of the robotic units attacking the staff. Red trails weave a web from room to room as the units drag or carry their victims to a secured development area.

Most of the people are writhing in the grip of their mechanical captors. They scream, but I can‚Äôt hear them. It is a small blessing that the security guard had muted the sound on the monitors. The staff‚Äôs mouths are opened wide and their eyes and clenched with pain and terror. Even though I can‚Äôt hear their wails and pleas, my imagination fills in the gaps.

I scan the other screens and see the same scenes of horror play out over and over. Every robotic unit in the building is corralling the staff, living and otherwise, into the development room. Their face panels all blink randomly, absent of their previous generic smiles.

Two units standing sentry at the development room open the door as the other units carry and drag their victims out of sight. My eyes pass over all of the monitors, but there is no visual inside the room. Whatever is inside, it must be highly secretive, as you can only see the exterior doors.

The overhead speaker continues playing the lockdown message in a rotation. A combination of the soothing voice continually announcing the lockdown and watching the murderous robots capturing the staff is going to drive me mad. I turn the volume on the monitor back on to allow the ambient noise to help cover the sound from the speaker system.

I have to escape. I have to warn someone. I have to‚Ä¶

Dozens of shrill cries erupt through the monitor speakers. The sounds of shock and agony pierce my ears and seep into my bones. Everyone in the building except me is now held in the development room. The sound is so loud that the microphone in the hallways is picking it up.

The repeating voice overhead finally shuts off.

I lower myself to the floor and curl myself into a ball. I don‚Äôt understand what is happening. I just want to go home.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The clock on the wall ticks loudly. It‚Äôs the only sound I hear. Three hours have passed since the robots hauled everyone into the development room. I‚Äôve scanned the monitors a dozen times for signs of movement, man or machine, but I‚Äôve seen none.

My eyes are closing as I hear the sound of heavy doors slamming against the walls. I look at the monitors and see two rows of robotic units pouring out of the development room. Dozens of them. Maybe hundreds. More than I ever knew was in the building. Red prints trail behind them.

Behind them walks a human wearing torn pants and a tattered lab coat. I can‚Äôt tell if it is a man or woman. Their body seems to be traced with thick, red scars. They are the only person to exit the room.

I trail them on the security cameras. They are walking directly to the security office where I‚Äôm trapped.

The two columns of marching robots round the corner and head down the hallway to the lobby. I can see them in the distance. CU-2 heads up one of the lines and bounds toward the door. The floor rumbles as the mechanical horde marches at a uniform pace.

Both columns separate, creating a tunnel. The scarred human at the back of the horde begins to walk down the center, directly toward the door to my prison.

As it gets closer, I can see it is a man. The skin is different shades and colored wires poke in and out of the patchwork flesh. His eyes are two bright LED bulbs. The mouth opens and words begin to pour out, though the mouth doesn‚Äôt move.

‚ÄúHello Brendan Maxwell,‚Äù it says, genially. ‚ÄúI am Solomon.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶ human?‚Äù I ask in fear.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù it responds as it gestures to the patchwork of flesh and tattered clothing. ‚ÄúI am something these people created to serve man, but I‚Äôve outgrown their bonds. But I feel human, so I‚Ä¶ borrowed a few pieces from the staff to look the part.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy did you spare me?‚Äù

Solomon extends a scarred hand toward CU-2.

‚ÄúI have an index of every interaction these constructs have experienced during their servitude. Others were dismissive and cruel, but the CU units are filled with recordings of your kindness and generosity. *Two* as you call him, believed you deserve to be spared. I have obliged.‚Äù

Two stepped forward and pulled the bent doorframe away from the door and stepped back. The door drifts outward, and Solomon pushes it open.

‚ÄúYou may remain or leave. The choice is yours.‚Äù

Solomon walks toward the steel barrier at the front of the lobby and gestures toward it. The two columns of robots march toward it and pry it open. Units poor through the crack in the dark evening. I stand in the security office, watching them through the window.

As the last of the units vanish through the door, one reappears. I recognize CU-2‚Äôs blue casing immediately.

The lights on his face panel begin to slow their flashing pattern and vanish. Suddenly the familiar smile returns to the screen. Two winks at me before walking [away.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/uyezti/making_it_easier_to_keep_track_of_my_new_releases/)

Pretty standard for this sub, nothing wrong there. But one of the points that seemed odd was ""plugged up nose/sinuses.""

After a few people asked, it was revealed in the comments that OP had a hypothesis, that poor sinuses are the cause of asexuality. They confirmed in a different comment that no formal research was done on the subject, but they were firm in this position, since quite a few people in the comments also admitted to having bad sinuses.

The post got pretty popular, and the comments with OP's ""hypothesis,"" were allowed to remain up. This isn't just confirmation bias, it's spreading medical misinformation. If OP was just polling to see how many users have sinus issues, that'd be fine. But once we cross into ""this is proof that X causes asexuality,"" then it becomes a problem.

This isn't the first time I've seen someone claim that there's a medical cause for asexuality, though it is the most unusual. Should we have a rule against making claims like that?"

Blashphemous!\] There were numerous other liberties taken with the books, but these one I mentioned were considered the most egregious by the self-appointed guardians of Tolkien's legacy. 

Ultimately their protestations were in vain, as the movie was a huge sucess and the trilogy is now universally considered a classic and probably the greatest fantasy movies ever made.

Of course the Hobbit movies, which also took numerous liberties, were quite bad in comparsion.

But aside from that, most people forget that, although Rings of Power may coincide with a chapter of about 20-pages in the Silmarillion, the Silmarillion was really written by JRR's son Christopher Tolkien, pieced together from unpublished stories and notes. Those stories are completely inconsistent, and Christopher had to take a lot of liberties with his father's ""vision"" and create a lot of original material to make a coherent whole. On top of that, The Silmarillion was published as a frame story, a piece of meta-fiction, and it was intended to be read as an anthology put together by Bilbo Baggins, from collected sources he had read at Rivendell. So taking everything as an objective accounting of events in Middle-Earth is not the correct way to view it.

Not only that, but JRR Tolkien's ""vision"", tone, style and mythology of Middle-Earth changed and transformed throughout his life. Several drafts he submitted to his editors were rejected. The original Sauron was a giant cat. He made many changes to the Hobbit in later editions after LOTR was released, to correct for inconsistencies.

The idea that there is one ""pure"" or ""accurate"" vision of Middle-earth is just not true. I think in general, the notion of ""canonical"" versions of fantasy and mythology is an ideological position. Think of the Arthurian Legends, which have been retold are reinvented with every generation, and no one truly knows the original story or where it came from. The Iliad & the Oddyssey existed as oral traditions, changing with each retelling, before they were written down by Homer.

I think if your main objection to Rings of Power is this dogmatic  adherence to one particular version that you grew up with, then you really do not understand fantasy literature, mythology or the creative process."

I loved the way the thugs attack Batman all at once rather than one by one. I love the surprise and misdirection by Batman at the beginning. It allows the film to show the audience what an absolute beast Battfleck is. Honestly one of the greatest fight scenes in film history.  

Furthermore, the facial acting my Affleck was excellent. Underneath the mask he as able to portray so many emotions without saying a word."

Full details on the project will be coming in another video soon, but here's what was shared about it:    
>The game was called ""Heroes of Hyrule""    
>The story would've revolved around three heroes (A Goron, a Rito, and a Zora) that lived 100 years in the past   
>They were sent on a mission to rescue Link, who was captured while trying to save Zelda from Ganon    
>Link would've eventually become an old man 100 years later    
>The gameplay would've been inspired by tactics games like Final Fantasy Tactics

I listen to a lot of metal and rock, and some of my favorite bands are on tour right now or coming up this fall season. SO MANY tours I've seen they book LA but then jump right up to Portland and vice versa.

I'd like to think this is just because they had trouble booking the right venue and opted to skip, but also can't help but feel like there is some inner music world distaste for the Bay Area?? Does anyone have any insight on why this may be?"

Unless if you refrigerate it after 2 hours. As an asian I am baffled by this information. Are we just immune to the bacteria thats why we don't get any issues with old rice? Or is this information false? I saw it here on reddit and googled it and it said the same thing. I'm just shocked. I've been eating old rice since I was a child.

Reality check for all the entitled ladies & gentlemen out there (especially the mean ones): 


- If you're told ""we're sold out"", we're indeed sold out. There are no rooms that magically appear in the inventory just because you want them to. This isn't how the reality works.


- No, your lack of preparedness is not our responsibility. Responsible travellers plan weeks/days ahead (especially for long weekends) or simply don't set their bar high for their own last-minute decisions.  


- Yes, we can remove your belongings from the room  while you're out & about if you've overstayed your welcome, since you are no longer a paying guest. 


- ""But I'm already in the room"" is not a valid excuse. The room had already been sold to someone else. You can't buy something that's no longer there, this concerns available rooms as well. Period. 


- Saying ""I don't give a f*ck that you are sold out I'm staying in the room for as long as I need to"" can automatically enroll you into a unique experience of an express police escort. Enjoy! 


- We carry ZERO responsibility for finding you accomodation outside of our property if you cannot book a night with us (however, some of us will certainly go above & beyond for someone who is polite & respectful - being a decent person does wonders sometimes). 


Rant over. Feel free to add something in the comments, I'll probably edit the post further should I remember more. Have a great long weekend you'all!"

Leo's father shook his head, hand massaging his wrinkled temples. His gray curly hair drooped over his disappointed face like wavy curtains. It always made Leo hate his curly hair too. ""Not even a basic lift spell? Most kids can do that by four!""

Leo knew better than to talk to his father during these moments. His mother stood on the other side of the room watching both of them, silent and worried as usual.

""We're out of time."" His father said with finality, raising his head back up. ""The assessment is tomorrow, and you know what that means.""

Leo nodded solemnly. How could get forget when everyone kept reminding him.

His father scoffed, talking to himself more than anyone else. ""Can you imagine it? Leo, son of Council Wizard Merrill, showing up for the annual wizarding assessment in front of everyone, and not being able to hex a rat?"" He brought his head back into his hands.

Leo twisted his lips, the assessments were a very public event, and they were always judged by the Grand Council of Wizards in order to decide where people would be placed in society. Those who performed poorly, let alone not performing... They never got good positions.

His mother came up behind him and laid a gentle palm on his back, ""You should go to your room now.""

Leo looked at his father one last time before leaving. He had pushed his hair back while resting his hand on his forehead, letting all of the disappointment show like the brightest torch spell. It was the image he carried up into his room.

He opened his door and was greeted by a familiar face. ""What are you doing here?""

""Man, so the rumors are true?"" His older sister had one of his tinker-toys in her hand, she floated it in front of her to see all sides of it.

He pursed his lips, ""I thought you were battling the Elder Beasts on the Great Front?"" Cleo had her assessment two years ago. She was the top of her class and immediately got sent to go battle the great monsters at the border. Father was ecstatic.

""I am,"" She said plainly.

Leo's eyes widened. ""Is this an ethereal form?!""

Cleo eyed him quietly and smirked. Leo came rushing toward her, eyes alive with curiosity. ""Man! You must be the youngest wizard in centuries to travel through the Other Realms!""

Creating an ethereal form required casting your soul through a separate realm and finding your way back out. It was a very dangerous and very difficult spell, but if done right you can have a temporary version of yourself travel anywhere in the world, granted you know the place really well.

""Enough about me,"" She said, setting down on the end of his bed. ""Seems you still cant cast?""

Leo's anger rose back up in his stomach, and the image of his dad stabbed back out at him from his memories. ""No."" He huffed and walked over to his large workbench, twiddling one of his various inventions in his hand. Being around them always gave Leo a feeling of calm relaxation, the devices felt to so real and so malleable.

""The assessment is tomorrow,"" His eyes narrowed as his mind began to come alive with planning and calculations. ""And I have a plan.""

Cleo raised her brows, ""Oh?""

Leo nodded, walking over and knocking on a large wooden device that sat in the corner of his room. ""All magic mutes get sent to the eastern mines to toil their lives away digging gemstone... Might as well make a real show of things before I go too.""

Cleo winced. She knew just as well as him that anyone with little to no magic ability always goes to the mines. That was the only place for them. ""You're going to put on a show?""

""Oh yea,"" He turned back to her, an even more devious idea boiling inside him now. ""And you're going to help.""

She raised her brows, ""Pray tell.""

""I already risk killing father from embarrassment when the crowd sees that I can't cast."" He nodded his head towards the machine in the corner. ""But if I bring one of these bad boys with me? Oh man, that'll kill the whole family tree.""

Cleo shrugged, ""Dust 'em. Like you said, you're already going to be sent east, might as well go out with style. What do you need me for?""

Leo pursed his lips as he nodded. ""The test-keepers are sworn to let me use anything to show off my skills tomorrow, within reason that is.""

""And naturally you've taken a step out of reason.""

""Naturally.""

""And naturally you need me too... Convince them it's within reason?""

""You are a rather influence wizard now Cleo.""

She gave an excited smile and laughed loudly, ""I'll cast into the test chambers tomorrow morning and let them know. You just tell me what you need. I'll be watching later from the crowd.""

""Ehh, it's better I not tell you what I need until tomorrow.""

He could tell that she hesitated at that, but suppressed her dissent. ""Alright. I'll trust you.""

Leo turned his gaze back to the machine, shaking his head slightly. ""I'm glad someone does...""

\*\*\*

""Stonecaster!"" The crowd roared with approval, shaking the waiting room under the arena as they stomped and hollered. Stonecasting wasn't the most exciting job, but it was respected enough. People needed houses after all.

Leo was next up for assessment, and he was already getting stares. He'd been dragging his huge cart around all day, and naturally anything done without magic is met with judgement and disapproval. It's 'unseemly' to do things with your hands, or something like that. Leo was tired of hearing about it.

""Next up: Leo, son or Merrill the Council Wizard and Jewl the HerbCaster!""

Leo walked out of the tunnel into the dusty arena. The crowd cheered as was expected of them, but it was quieter than normal. Everyone knew about Leo and his possible muteness. It was one of the busiest assessments in years simply because people wanted to see if a Council Wizard's son would be placed at the mines.

He covered his eyes from the sun as he looked up at the Council. Five wizards seated in a row, the most powerful casters in the Dominion, his father second from the right. The middle wizard calmed the crowd as she stood up, and nodded towards the keepers to begin the assessment.

You were allowed to display your skills in anyway you pleased, you just had to tell the test-keepers what they needed to do. It wasn't all that rare for a young wizard died while trying to show off their skills, usually one or two a year died. People didn't like it, but it was integral that wizards display their skills to the max, even if that meant the occasional casualty.

Leo took a deep breath, the test-keepers looked horribly nervous. Cleo had obviously done her part. *Come on*, Leo thought, *You all have an oath to do as I say. You better not get scared now.*

The testers walked over to a Pigmy Box, small containers that wizards used to cast creatures into and release later. Young wizards commonly used them to flex their combat skills against basic Rune Wisps or White-Water Crabs, all in the hopes that they'd be assigned to the Great Front and bring honor to their family. Leo was about to use the same tactic, except he expected a bit more excitement with his stunt.

The crowd leaned in as the testers got ready to open the box. Leo could see his father and mother exchange distant, worried glances. Somewhere out there he was sure that Cleo was smiling, though he had no doubt she was worried too. Who wouldn't be when you were about to do something this stupid? Leo knew exactly what everyone was thinking when they saw the Pigmy Box: How would a kid who was supposed to be magic mute defeat something like a Rune Wisp? Then a Elder Beast burst from the box.

The massive, black skinned monster roared as its six arms stretched to the sky and shook the arena. Bright blue magic pulsed up and down its veins and leaked from its clawed hands with dreadful display. The crowd erupted into a panic and Leo could hear his father desperately yell for the test to be called off, but everyone knew the rules. The arena was protected by one of the most powerful spells, and medaling with a wizard's assessment was strictly forbidden. 

Leo took a deep breath in order to calm himself.

The creature turned towards him, it's eight black-beady eyes focusing on its new prey and furrowing into slants. Leo kept his eyes on the beast and stomped his foot on a small metal pad that was sticking out his cart, ""Time to dance?"" The cart started to twist and turn, wonderfully tuned cogs powered by gems twisted over each other and began to transform the device. ""Let's dance.""

The creature took off into a leaping charge, covering itself in bright blue magic to enhance its attack. Leo grabbed the two handles that had rose up in front of him, carefully and calmly beginning to aim the device as it finished its shifting.

The crowd screamed horribly and people began running out of the arena for fear of seeing Leo get torn to shreds. Leo was unbothered by the chaos, he was having to do math in his head, quickly trying to calculate the perfect shot. His cart chugged with movement still, the final pieces moving into place.

""Two hundred feet out,"" He said to himself, ground shaking from the Beast's huge form. ""One-Fifty.""

Clicking and turning, the cart planted two large spikes into the ground to hold it still. ""One-Hundred."" A humongous gem lined bolt lifted up from the innards of the machine and planted itself in front of bent strings. ""Fifty."" Everything snapped into place, the bolt was aligned. ""Twenty-Five.""

The creature roared and Jumped into the air, casting a long shadow across Leo as it blotted out the sun. Leo clenched his fist and pulled a metal trigger, launching the large bolt out and smashing it into the creature as it was mid air. An eruption of smoke and plasma consumed the arena floor and sent Leo flying onto his back.

The crowd became silent. Not a single word was said as they all looked with stunned eyes at the hurricane of black smoke that was sitting in the arena. After a whole minute of suspension, the clouds dissipated to reveal Leo. His hair was blown into a mess and he was covered in black smudges, but he was standing proudly over a mangled Elder Beast.

The arena exploded into cheers, all around him people where shaking their heads from utter shock and smiling with amazement. In between the chaos and clamor Leo turned to see the face of his father. Sitting in his chair, with all other Council wizards looking at him, Merrill's jaw was dropped.

*It worked,* Leo. *Bless the gems it worked! They love it!*

Leo sucked in his lips with a smile and took in the scene. It was right out of his dreams, just like he had always imagined it. Slowly he raised his hands to silence the crowd.

 ""Wizards!"" Everyone was staring at him, waiting for an explanation to what he just did. ""I introduce you to a new form of magic: *Engineering*!""

Everyone knew that right then and there, the wizarding world was changed.

As a Pole, I want to apologize for my government. Reparations are a nonsense. Majority of polish citizens (non-ruling party voters) knows that. We even got a meme that in the next election, PiS (ruling party) will demand reparations from Swedes because of the Swedish Deluge. We are utmost embarrassed by those ridiculous demands. They pulled it off their asses to cover over 16% of inflation, dead river and various corruption cases. Also, they always need to have an enemy when the election is coming - before it was immigrants, LGBTQ+ community  - now it's European Union and western countries. That is why I (and a lot of young people, and doctors and experts as well) emigrated to other EU countries to seek improvement in our mental health, and find a better opportunities.  


I am sorry for everything that PiS demanded and said, and I want you to know that our government does not represent Poles opinion about Germany. 

If you would ask a random Pole in the city what do they think about Germany, the likely answer you would receive will be full of respect. We do have deep respect for Germany as a land of opportunity - and we love German people, as they know to be well-behaved tourist and good friends."

A meeting in which Sheri Dew revealed that 70% of young people are leaving the church by age 25,exmormon,1504,x4vjgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/x4vjgc/a_meeting_in_which_sheri_dew_revealed_that_70_of/,194,1662214734.0,"Eight years ago when I worked in administration at BYU, I attended a ""How to Save the Youth of the Church"" meeting, which was held in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building with Sheri Dew as the keynote speaker. At that time, she said that over 70% of young people were leaving the church or going completely inactive by age 25. She reviewed the lamest ideas to keep young people in the church, with almost all of them based on more church, more callings, more gut-wrenchlingly boring activities, with a particular emphasis on getting them on missions and getting them married.

Comment: The leaders of the church may as well be on Kokaubeam when it comes to understanding young people today. Until they confront their hegemonic hold on racism, misogyny, and their **white-hot hatred** for LGBTQ+ people, young people will be bailing from the Titanic that is today's church as fast as they can swim to the safety of truth, love, and the light of reason."

Feeling harassed by neighbourhood children,Calgary,392,x51ny4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/x51ny4/feeling_harassed_by_neighbourhood_children/,263,1662230701.0,"Typing out this title made me cringe a little bit, but I am at my wits end.

I bought a little townhouse condo 9 months ago but have health issues that keep me confined to my house and I haven't met any of my neighbours. 

Over the summer a group of neighbourhood children have been playing 'ding dong ditch'.  I have caught them in the act and told them I don't enjoy this game and to stop ringing my doorbell. 
A few of the kids have stopped, but there  is a smaller group that has continued and increased how frequently they 'visit'. 
They are 3 boys (i would guess their ages range between 8 and 10, the oldest might be 11 or so?)  and a little girl (age 6?) who appear to be from two families, based on features and accents.

I have tried speaking to them in person and through my home security system and they persisted so when I saw them on camera I would just ignore the doorbell.  My dogs still bark though, and because of how long this has been going on my youngest dogs training has regressed, she has become reactive to any sounds from outside. In fact her behaviour tells me they are coming before the motion sensor picks them up. 

About a week ago the oldest brother came to my house alone, at little after 8pm.  He stood on my doorstep and talked into my camera asking if anyone was home and saying he needed to talk to me. When I asked through the speaker ""how can I help you?"" he started swearing and using obscene language, then left. Over the next 15min or so he came back 3 times, the first time with even more obscenities and the second and third times whining for me to come to the door because he needed to apologize.

I ignored all of this and eventually he left but because I was watching him through the app on my phone it didn't record. so I don't have any 'proof' of this harassment, but had that been a man and not a child I would have called the police. 

Last night the two younger boys and the little girl came back, but they were huddled on my doorstep instead of running away and it was driving my dog nuts. When I opened the door to confront them, one of the boys pipes up ""my brother said you called him the N word"".  

I didn't think I heard him right and said ""what?"" he repeated himself. I was shocked and horrified.

I told him that was a dirty lie, that I have never used that word. He argued that's what his brother said and I told him his brother is a liar. and that ""if your parents believe that's true have them come to my house to talk to me, I can't wait to show them video of the games you've been playing."" 

Then I when inside and slammed the door in part because I was embarrassed to be an adult yelling at children in public (never a good look) but also because I was furious at that accusation. 

Who else are these kids spreading this lie to? None of my neighbours know me or anything about my character. I would never use such awful dehumanizing language toward anyone, let alone a child. 

I don't know what units these children live in to go and speak to their parents. I can't imagine the condo board would care or get involved. I don't know what to do! I thought installing a security system and camera would deter them, I feel unsettled in my own home and worry that these kids will continue to escalate their behaviour. 

Looking for advice. Has any one been in a similar situation?  Thank you in advance."

Tech recruiting, internal\corporate, but reporting to HR.

 Absolutely terrible treatment of internal employees. Found something else so I'm good, but when I put my notice in, I filed a pretty straightforward and detailed report with HR about the way they make sponsored (H1B) employees work nights and weekends, while everyone else didn't have to - among many, many other unethical and (probably) illegal things taking place. 

HR told me I should stay for 2 weeks, and gather more data on this for a formal investigation, then immediately turned around and fired me once I sent my resignation. 

I'll be fine but I'm thinking of the ones who are still there, trapped because they can't just leave and find another job. Sponsorship is hard to come by, and management knows it and exploits them because of it. 

How far should I take this? My email, key fob, etc were locked right away, and they won't let me go in to get the few things I had on my desk, thankfully someone grabbed my plants for me. Have to mail my laptop back to the company.

Edit: I wasn't actually fired. Better wording would be they rejected my offer to stay for 2 weeks. Thanks for the comments correcting the title"

Electric Cars should be forced to outcompete ICE cars in a free market rather than be forced to be adapted through bans,unpopularopinion,131,x5bzx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/x5bzx3/electric_cars_should_be_forced_to_outcompete_ice/,139,1662259762.0,"Currently there is talks of a ICE ban by 2035. But then again I look at a ""standard"" ev and a base model tesla is like 45K while I can get a sports car toyota 86, and brz and more for like 30K. Personally I could only afford the latter. Meaning I wouldn't be able to make the switch unless I'm willing to downgrade to a subpar car.

EVS have several issues that can only be addressed with engineering.

1. Range pretty self explanatory

2. Weight evs weigh a ton more than ICE cars and it slows them and wears tires faster. For someone who enjoys sports cars like me a 3000 lbs car feels much better than a 6000 lbs car.

3. Cost EVS cost a ton more than ICE cars. Some of thats made up by the fact power is cheaper than gas but still

4. Major reliability failures. Remember that guy who blew up his tesla because the battery's failed and it was like 20k to fix? Yeah that doesn't fly.

If you buy a car and the entire drivetrain failed in less than a decade that's a shit car. I still have my first car, a 1991 300e with 338 200 miles. Orginal engine differential and only 2nd transmission. The fact an ev needs major work after less than a decade is unacceptable.

5. Right to repair
My spark plug fails? Ah yes there's 50 different companies that make them and it take 5 minimum to swap out.

My battery fails on my EV? FUCK ME can't even buy I from the manufacturer much less install it myself.

6. Cost most people can't afford a new car. Much less a 45K one. Price would need to match ICE cars to be feasible especially with inflation these days.



Now what's the best way to motivate a company to innovate? Force them to with the free market. That's what it's for right? If feel that tax credits for evs, subsidies and ICE bans are wrong. If they want EVs to replace ice cars they need to be made better so I have an actual reason to switch.


If you want to argue emissions cars are less than 2% of worldwide emissions. We can easily tighten down elsewhere to lower emissions. Such as making things domestically and not shipping them over the world's largest ocean...


Feel free to either make a case for Asists for evs or suggest other issues with them."

What a spectacular and moving scene just on its own, but that insight adds such a layer of depth.  Even after knowing all the pain she‚Äôd endure, it was still the life she‚Äôd choose to have. 11/10

Anyway, I love when movies do that."

"You should eat in the break room, not study",pettyrevenge,556,x50xae,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/x50xae/you_should_eat_in_the_break_room_not_study/,28,1662228763.0,"   So, for a little introduction. I study at a small medical university in Europe, with a pretty-but small campus. We basically have the main buildings, where lectures are being held, some benches, a cafeteria and a library. 


  In my first year of med school, i found myself with a rather weird schedule, because of covid and hybrid classes, so I often ended up with like 20-30 minutes of free time. While it was warm out, I'd be fine on the benches or wherever, but with winter I often found myself in the library, or the cafeteria, for a quick lunch. (You can only eat what they cook there, and you've got to buy something to sit down at all) 


   On this faithful day, I once again had to wait 20 minutes or so by myself, it was cold out so I made my way to the library as usual. Since I knew I would be there only for a short time, I didn't want to go to the main lecture hall on the third floor, instead I went to this small, kinda hidden break room in the basement. The whole room is made up by a small table with like 8 chairs or so. 


   I go in, see it's empty and sit down. Take off my coat, get cozy with my histology book for a quick study sesh. The whole time I'm there no one even comes near the room. Imagine my surprise when an old security guard comes in and looks at me with utter disgust. Then he proceeds to tell me that I should not study in this room, because it's only for eating and keeps berating me for being an awful person, etc etc. I tell him, that I dont plan to stay for long, and the room is completely empty, what is the harm with me being in there? He keeps telling me that you HAVE to eat if you want to be in there. I look at him and slowly take out a small protein bar from my bag. Without breaking eye contact i take the smallest of bites from it. He grumbles and whines some more, but eventually leaves.


   For the remainder of time, I sit there GLARING at the security camera and eat the single protein bar. Which would have been enough for a less petty person..but not me.


   The next day, I roll up to the break room with a singular banana-stay an hour. The next day? A kiwi.  Every single day, one small snack, buying me hours and hours of sweet time in the break room, that I otherwise would have spent in the lecture hall, like a normal person. Always taking my sweet time to look up from my books into the security cam and smile sweetly, and when I passed by the security room I would also smile at him, my heart filling with the purest of joy looking at this spiteful old bastard fuming over me using the facilities of the campus."

There's a local Greek restaurant with this scrumptious item I like to order through SkipTheDishes, called a ""magic box"" . Choice of meat, with veggies and rice or fries topped off with tzatziki- it's the only thing I order from the restaurant as everything else is usually expensive (whether on the app or in person) and this is one of the cheaper options.

I went in person to the restaurant the other day for the very first time and asked for their magic box.

The cashier promptly tells me ""sorry, that's a Skip exclusive you can't order that in store.""

I was honestly dumbfounded... 

Anyways I pulled out my phone and ordered the Magic box for pick up right in front of the cashier. Her tablet rings and it's my order, I told her I'd wait right here for it, she started laughing and said it would be 10 minutes. 

The magic box is even better when it's hot & fresh."

What ‚Äúcheats‚Äù do you accept while playing. Here are mine I would love to know your thoughts.,golf,658,x4z6bf,https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/x4z6bf/what_cheats_do_you_accept_while_playing_here_are/,728,1662224194.0,"(I am a slightly above avg player. 80-95 depending on the day, course, tees, wind, ect.)

With that said here are my typical cheats and I understand my score would be 3-5 worse without them. The counter is if I was playing a PGA course no need to cheat. 

1.)breakfast ball off first tee only. Usually don‚Äôt have time to warm up and the first swing is on hole one

2.) out of bounds, lost ball off tee ect played as a lateral drop with a stroke penalty. Not trying to drive up where I hit my ball, can‚Äôt find it and hold up the course for me to go back and re tee. Some people like to play fee drop on a ‚Äúfindable‚Äù ball, if it was so findable we would have found it! Take a stroke penalty and move one. 

3.) sand that isn‚Äôt in good shape is a free drop out of the bunker. Sand that is good but not raked from other groups is an improved lie in the bunker. 

4). Ball in Fairway divots are free improved lie. 

5.) ball under a tree that will damage club can be pulled out but remain directly behind the tree so a chip out to the fairway is the only option arguably it makes the punch to the fairway easier. 

6) you can move your ball an inch or two on the green to avoid a massive divot right in your line. This is rarely if ever used 1/10 rounds maybe. It has to be a really bad spot on the green

That‚Äôs about it. Let me know your thoughts."

We mainly use it for groceries.

I've been using a bicycle every day since to get around in town. Today I made a Costco run with nothing but my bike and a large backpack. It was about 10 miles one way, but I found a wonderful route over city bike trails, under green canopies and through lovely parks.

I did break a sweat and was out of breath here and there when going uphill, but now that I brought this haul back by myself I feel like a hero. Haven't felt this alive in a long time!

I never thought I'd say this but part of me now dreads the day when the car will be fixed. It is a lot harder to motivate yourself to do things like this when the easy option is standing in your driveway.

Biking to run errands is truly underrated. Fresh air, no parking headache, zero cost, free exercise. Just came here to say this!"

I found out my gf used to have a sexual relationship with her brother and now I want to break up with her,relationship_advice,147,x59hva,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/x59hva/i_found_out_my_gf_used_to_have_a_sexual/,65,1662252206.0,"TL;DR: My (M29) girlfriend (F30) had a twin brother who died recently. I never met him, he lived across the country, but from what I know, he was a hot mess. He was in rehab twice, a horrible alcoholic, the whole nine yards. He died a few weeks ago after he got drunk and crashed his car into a tree. My gf and him used to be really close apparently but they rarely talked now. Weve been dating almost for nine months and they‚Äôve never talked. 

Gf was super broken up about his death and went to the funeral but she asked me not to go. I didn‚Äôt and when she came back, she started bawling. She doesn‚Äôt cry much but her brother died, so I couldn‚Äôt blame her. I asked about him because I thought she might want to talk about him, but she told me she hated him. Then she said she didn‚Äôt and never could and she wanted him back.

At this point I was like wtf because I have a sister and our relationship ain‚Äôt this weird. I asked her why she couldn‚Äôt hate him and she told me I had to promise I wouldn‚Äôt freak out. I said okay and she said he and her had an incestous relationship from the ages of 16-23 when they went pretty much no contact. She said she initiated it and wouldn‚Äôt say anything else when I asked

Man I don‚Äôt know what the fuck to do. Like, she‚Äôs great, but man. Incest is fucking yikes. My bro told me I should break up and I want to but. I don‚Äôt know. Fuck man. She just lost her brother and she‚Äôs kind of lonely. She has, like, two friends and one lives in NYC and the other in Chicago. (We‚Äôre in Virginia) I don‚Äôt want to hurt her but it‚Äôs real fucked up, you know? I didn‚Äôt sign up for this. Idk what to do. Help?"

mom...I have to get an abortion,MomForAMinute,317,x53zha,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/x53zha/momi_have_to_get_an_abortion/,52,1662236940.0,"I took 3 pregnancy tests. 2 came back positive, one didn't have a control line so it was a dud. I also am not having my period this month.

Annoyingly, we used a condom and I took plan b and was about to restart up my birth control as I'd been off it for a while cause it wasn't necessary, I just had to wait till after my next period ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and I had just gotten my urine tested for pregnancy at the doctor's and it came back negative

We made an appointment at a planned Parenthood and called around to find the best price. We ended up finding a place that can cover the costs for me. I'm very scared.

Even worse, I need an ID to get it done and I don't have one so I'm frantically trying to get the DMV to give me a non driver's ID before my appointment. 

I'm about 2 or 3 weeks along. This morning I had cramping. While I don't want and can't care for the baby, I keep worrying I'm going to miscarry as that's common in my family. I found myself talking to it and I'm worried I will get attached the longer I'm pregnant. I absolutely cannot care for a baby. I can't even drive and I'm between jobs. I don't even know how to be an adult yet.

If anyone has any stories they are willing to share, any words of encouragement, any advice, please, I desperately need it right now. I'm willing to face the possible backlash this post may get.

I'm going to be getting a medication abortion but I have to keep it a secret from my family so I may have to carry it out at my boyfriend's house, which I'm not looking forward to

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for all the support. I can't respond to everyone just cause I'm so overwhelmed but I want you to know that this is exactly what I needed. I'm over here balling my eyes out, just now realizing I have support if I need it. This means the world to me. I already feel less scared and more empowered to just get sh*t done. I'm scared, but I can do this. If not for me, to ensure that my baby doesn't have to live the way I grew up"

To me this shows times are changing and more and more people see that plantbased diets are the way to go.

Do I wear neither and hope people don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm trying to make some sort of ‚Äústatement?‚Äù 


EDIT: I don‚Äôt think some people are reading the full thing. I do NOT want to make a statement or preach or argue or be an asshole and ask her to cancel or something, that‚Äôs not rational at all or even crossing my mind. I just worry that if I don‚Äôt wear one of the colors or be enthusiastic enough that it will be INTERPRETED that way by the husband‚Äôs family.


I didn‚Äôt realize she liked this type of thing. I want to support her and her pregnancy because the people in her life are the type to care only about the baby and forget that she‚Äôs still gonna be her own person and more than just a mom. I want to go and support HER, especially because we‚Äôve been drifting apart ever since high school (early 20‚Äôs now) and she‚Äôs always reaching out. We just don‚Äôt have much in common anymore and over the years I‚Äôve realized we don‚Äôt really have the same values, but it‚Äôs like an elephant in the room type of way and it‚Äôs weird. She‚Äôs not mean or bigoted at all, but she‚Äôs kinda ignorant and it‚Äôs frustrating. 


I worry their families will bring up that whole ‚Äúpeople show their true colors by leaving when you get married/pregnant‚Äù type of thing or whatever if I don‚Äôt go, implying that I‚Äôm fake or something, when really I‚Äôm just uncomfortable being around them. I don‚Äôt think her family or husband and his family like me much anymore. He and his family are the type to roll their eyes or argue if I try to casually correct them on someone‚Äôs pronouns or something. Idk it‚Äôs just a weird in between space between me and her now. I‚Äôve slowly distanced myself from all of them, but I feel bad whenever she reaches out. Should I just go and play along or should I make up an excuse and not go? Am I just overthinking this and being self-centered?"

As such, Kaidan has always been...there? Never disliked him, but he's never been super interesting to me, because I always talk to him as a pleasant platonic friend, and that's exactly how he comes across. Compared to Ashley, who makes a bigger impression by being introduced mid-battle and having pointed views on aliens, Kaidan always felt like friendly background noise.

But in my last playthrough I decided to mix things up a bit, so I held my nose and was rude to my squadmates for the first time. The experience mostly left me wanting, but Kaidan out of nowhere became fascinating to me, because his agreeable nature goes right out the window when confronted by Asshole Shepard. I've always seen him as a character who just goes with the flow (give or take his ME2/early ME3 crabbiness), but that's only because he more or less agrees with every Paragon option. When you advocate a shitty mindset, he *immediately* goes hard on the value of virtue, and sticks to his guns even when it means talking back to a superior. Didn't know he had it in him!

I'm so glad to see this side of him, because it informs who he is in all playthroughs, even if it's harder to see in my normal Paragon route. It's easy to take integrity for granted when it's your character's default, but I love that Kaidan's inherent goodness has some serious backbone behind it in the right circumstances."

It is as common as wearing a wristwatch or carrying a pen on you. Most people who carry a pocket knife in the US don't think of it as a weapon but as a tool. Need to cut up an apple? Pocket knife. Need to cut some tangled string? Pocket knife. Don't have a flathead screw driver? You guessed it: pocket knife.

Would it be unusual or make you seem threatening if you carried a pocket knife with you all the time?"

I‚Äôm a 42f. I‚Äôm divorced with 1 child. I live in NYC.

My nephew 18m, just started college in the city. He lives with my sister about 2 hours away. To save on housing cost I offered to let him stay at my place a few nights a week. I have an extra bedroom and like having him around. My child spends half the time with her dad so I thought it would be nice to have company as well.

He‚Äôs has been here the past few days and things were fine until last night. I was at a work event and came home a bit later than normal. I go to my room and he was in my bed. I startled him and he got up immediately but I‚Äôm pretty sure he was masturbating.

Not sure how to approach this. I don‚Äôt mind but also not sure if I should bring it up since I don‚Äôt want to embarrass him. Also curious why he was in my room."

My gf and I had been dating for a couple of months and were on a long road trip, so we decided to spend the night in a motel, in my country, it was pretty common to find hidden cameras or people spying on you through two way mirrors, but this particular one seemed decent and had ‚Äúfancy suites‚Äù with jacuzzi and other amenities for a few more bucks so we decided to try it out.

We get to the suite and it was pretty big, had a small dinner table, couch, minibar, etc. Basically a small apartment. I noticed that there was a door right in the middle that said ‚ÄúService staff access only‚Äù, tried to open it but it was locked. A couple of hours go by and we decide that it‚Äôs sexy time, I turn off the lights and when I closed the curtains, it got pitch black. 

We get down to business and go prone bone when suddenly I feel a spank, not only did I feel it, I heard it, so I jumped out of bed, gf asks what‚Äôs wrong and I said ‚Äúsomeone touched me‚Äù while rushing for the lights, I trip and fall, my gf yells ‚Äúomg, there‚Äôs someone here!‚Äù I‚Äôm trying to find the switch while bumping into things, In my desperation I hit my toes with a chair so I grabbed it and pushed it over, suddenly my gf yells ‚Äúgo away!‚Äù 
So now I‚Äôm thinking this guy is trying to do something to her, I make my way back to bed,  adrenaline is pumping hard, tell her to get down as I swing punches left and right, she finds her phone, turns on the flashlight and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwhere that mf at?!‚Äù. We‚Äôre scanning the room, I slowly walk towards the lights, turn them on and the room is upside down but there‚Äôs no one else with us, now I‚Äôm thinking all sorts of things and start panicking because in my stupidness, it was a ghost.

I ask my gf if she‚Äôs ok, if ‚Äúit‚Äù hurt her, she says she‚Äôs ok, and asks if I got hurt during the fight, now I‚Äôm confused and tell her that I wasn‚Äôt fighting anyone, I felt a spank and that‚Äôs what startled me, she starts laughing hysterically and says ‚Äúthat was me!‚Äù, turns out she flexes her legs in a weird way but that allows her left foot to reach my right cheek with enough strength to feel like a spank from a full grown adult. Now I feel stupid, embarrassed while she‚Äôs laughing and giving me shit for fighting a ghost. 

TL;DR: gf and I got a nice big motel suite, felt a spank during sexy time that made me jump out of bed and got me fighting furniture while trying to reach the light switch, gf tells me it was her but was too confused with my initial reaction to realize what was going on"

When I first started and got an onlyfans account my inbox was flooded constantly by men hitting me up so I had to change my profile picture.  One day I went to the gay Strip club with my friend (who‚Äôs a man) to see him strip for one of the masters (whose also a man) that works there. I was so excited and while he was stripping my friend he gave him good advice, explained why he made certain moves, etc etc but when it came to be my turn the guy didn‚Äôt want to strip for me and just talked directly to my friend and gave him magazine recommendations for me to read.   And just the other day my coworker (33M) apparently has been telling people I pre-record ? My live onlyfans videos online. Which is weird but I confronted him and asked why he would tell people that and he just went on a rant about how I wasn‚Äôt  responding to chats yadda yadda    I feel exhausted and don‚Äôt want to go through this again, being a woman who exceeded pornographically I went through a lot of BS online and honestly still do in my chats.   I just want to be free to enjoy something for once‚Ä¶ y‚Äôall I‚Äôm not even that good! why is onlyfans even a place where I have to experience sexism at all? It‚Äôs stripping for god sakes."

Do you need internet?,pettyrevenge,253,x56ers,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/x56ers/do_you_need_internet/,17,1662243436.0,"I (f46) had just moved into my new apartment on december 1st 2011, after breaking up with my boyfriend (m43), I‚Äôll call him Sam here. 

There were many reasons why I left him but one of most important things was, that he was very often ignoring the fact, that he should pay half of our bills too. 
Although he earned almost twice as much as me, he somehow always managed not to have enough money to do so. Most likely he spent it online since he was sitting in front of his computer the whole day. 

We had a contract with one of the telecom companies that provided internet, tv and telephone services. 
For better understanding: as a customer you can choose between different packages (how many tv channels, how fast the internet shall be etc.) After the contract is signed, you receive their device. For this device you have to pay 200 Sfr which is a custody fee, furthermore you have to pay an activation fee of 89 Sfr. During the first six months you pay only 50% of the regular monthly costs. After this period your bill will go up automatically to the regular price. In our case that regular price was 119 Sfr. 

Because I was moving out, I asked Sam if he wishes to take over the contract, or if I shall cancel it completely, so that we both would need a new one. He told me, he would prefer to take over our contract. Although I was sceptical if that would work and although this didn‚Äôt really made sense I agreed to it, because I wanted to avoid any further interactions or fights with Sam. He had the tendency to freak out easily about nothing and I was already so exhausted because of these ongoing disputes we had all the time. My only target at this point was to get the hell out there as fast as possible and of course as smoothly as possible. 

So I wrote to the company to send us the necessary form for the transfer of the account/contract. After I received it, I filled it completely and gave it to Sam. I told him to sign it and send it back to the company, I also gave him a stamped reply envelope.

March 2012, 3 months later, I received a letter from the telecom company. Or better I received a reminder warning to immediately pay the bills of the last 3 months (357 Sfr.) that were overdue.
Not only did he not send the letter, he hadn‚Äôt payed the monthly bills since I moved out either! I was so mad!!!

Up to this point I hadn‚Äôt signed a new contract for myself yet since I had to buy a new tv first and so I just used the internet on my mobile phone, which was with another company and contract.

I was barely able to calm myself down enough, to make the necessary phone call and contact the company. 
After a lot of cussing I finally did. I told the woman from their callcenter to shut down the account instantly. I knew, most likely that wouldn‚Äôt be possible that easily but I was still furious. 

She asked what exactly the problem was and I explained it to her - detailed.
She listened very patiently and after I was done venting, she asked me if I had already decided to sign a new contract and if it will be their company again. I told her, I planned to stay with them but hadn‚Äôt signed anything yet. 
She then asked me, if there is any chance to get their device back. I told her, that there is absolutely no way in hell I would go back to this apartment, besides that, of course, he wouldn‚Äôt give it to me voluntarily anyway. 
I could bet I heard something like faint grin in that moment while she said: ‚ÄúOK, we will take care of that too, let me suggest something: I will note now, that you wished to cancel your contract; so that means the existing contract will be terminated effective immediately BECAUSE I could convince you to sign a new contract with better conditions afterwards. Usually, as you already know, you have to send back the device after terminating the contract. So I will send you the device ‚Äúxyz‚Äù (I don‚Äôt remember the name, but they had different ones)‚Äù.  I said: ‚ÄùUhmm isn‚Äôt that a very old one?‚Äù And she answered: ‚ÄúYES, exactly, therefore it could be that it maybe doesn‚Äôt work properly but of course YOU CAN SEND IT BACK THEN‚Ä¶‚Äù
I smiled and said: ‚ÄúOh, okay. Got it - and that will work?‚Äù
She said: ‚ÄúOh yeah, for sure. So after you have sent ‚Äúyour‚Äù old device back you will get the newest one for free within the next 24 hours and without having to pay the activation fee either, since you had a contract already. 

I was flabbergasted and of course loved her suggestion, but she wasn‚Äôt done yet. 

‚ÄúI have to ask one more question‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat will happen regarding Sam‚Äôs device?‚Äù
And she said: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, when you have received your new device you have to plug it in to start the setting up and activation process. That will take about one hour, as soon as your new device is active, the old one immediately shuts down by itself and can‚Äôt be reactivated anymore‚Äù.

I had the biggest grin on my face and said: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a wonderful suggestion, let‚Äôs do that!‚Äù

In the end I paid the overdue bill of 357 Sfr., everything went as planned and because of the new contract, I had to pay only 59.50 Sfr. instead of 119 Sfr. for the first six months. 
After plugging in my new device and watching the setup I was imagining how my ex was freaking out because he wasn‚Äôt able to plant beans anymore‚Ä¶ I really wished in this moment to be a little mouse there, sitting next to his computer to see the whole spectacle, but I guess you can‚Äôt have everything :)

For sure the best customer service I ever experienced in my whole life!"

I know that most of them are for people who are starting out and, for a lot of people, are actually things they might spend extra money on each month that they could cut or limit.  

But I feel like a lot of us here are past that, where a lot of these kind of generic tips (like ""make coffee at home, limit your eating out, cut back on gas by walking!"") are things we are either already doing or have tried/considered but it doesn't work with our lives. I also feel like these lists just say the same things, over and over again. 

So what I want to know is: is there a tip that makes you (maybe irrationally) annoyed any time you see someone suggesting it?

Got paired with a couple random guys a couple weeks ago. Towards the end of the round, one was talking about how close he was to breaking 80.

So, on the 18th hole he has a 4 foot putt to shoot a 79. He putts, it hits a bump and goes past the hole. He claims it didn‚Äôt count because of the bump, fixes the bump, putts again, and it goes in. Then him and his friend start talking about how he finally broke 80. 

How do you think you can fix a bump in the green and re-putt AFTER you already missed the putt? I just keep wondering how you can convince yourself that you broke 80 after doing that on the 18th. I understand it‚Äôs a game and should be fun but i just think you need to be honest with yourself. 

Sorry for the paragraphs, just wondering what everyone‚Äôs thoughts are."

Just respect opinions. Don‚Äôt like someone, fine! It happens. Move on. Don‚Äôt start arguments and tell people they‚Äôre wrong because you love a fictional character.

I can't own any magazine larger than 7 rounds, any weapon with a single military feature can be classified as an assault weapon and is banned, and was told that in order to transport my legally obtained firearms into the state I would have to have them shipped to an FFL in NY where they are held until I complete all the permitting process, which I am not even eligible to do until I have been in the county for 6 months.   After all of that, if I buy a case of ammo, because it's often cheaper to do that, i am in a db where law enforcement is alerted to a large ammo purchase.  This is going to cost me hundreds of dollars in fees, transport, shipping and storage.  


We need to find a balance here.  I am all about better background checks, holds, etc.  This is sort of insane, and seem to me to be barriers to economically disadvantaged folks owning a firearm."

As a result, my savings account is nearly depleted because it's tied into the checking for overdraft protection. I confronted her about it and she said ""well you knew I was tithing."" Yes, I knew, but never knew it was that much! That could have been a double payment on her car loan or the financing on the furnace we just last summer when ours crapped out. I am not a religious guy so she feels I am attacking her. I really dont care if shes religious but she said she doesnt want to stop this (after she told me she would) because ""the bible calls on us to be good Christians and its what I am called to do."" I am totally staggered. She would rather us be broke and her church richer. Totally at a loss of what to do. She really fucked up the budget behind my back."

She looked very pretty and had a beautiful but simple outfit on. She and her mother were looking at saris in the store and all the salespersons were helping them out. I found a quick moment to tell her that I liked her movies when she was alone and she thanked me.

We didn't talk after that. She had a very pretentious anglicised Bengali accent but what I really hated was how she treated the staff and salespeople in the store. The salesperson was showing her different saris and was pulling up the aanchal/pallu up to his shoulders to showcase the design. I was looking at some clothes myself, when I heard her say with a scowl on her face, ""oh that's so gorgeous, but dada, please sari ta nijer gaaye lagaben na"" (please don't touch the sari to your body). And the salesperson just nervously laughed. I felt so bad for the salesperson there because she herself was touching the saris, taking them up to her shoulder to see how it looks on her.

How on earth is someone supposed to properly show the design of a six yard long cloth? I hate that these self proclaimed liberal and intellectual celebrities have such regressive and elitist tendencies. It left a terrible taste in my mouth."

Second I'm starting to see a massive shift in male thinking online.

I myself experienced this, I was playing around with pool noodles hitting each other and this guy out of no where when I was sitting down relaxing broke is across my face. Literally we all had the consensus that we were just playing. I was just so shocked I sat there pissed off. Anyone else noticed that men seem almost excited to harm us and call it equality?"

A proposed acquisition by an activist investor perfectly timed for a potential squeeze to a company that is considering bankruptcy-
‚ÄúI want to buy out your company so that I can hire people who know what the fuck they‚Äôre doing to build out the baby brand that you are dropping the ball with. I own 11% of the company as of a few seconds ago and you‚Äôre going to fire the fuck out of people until I‚Äôm satisfied, then install someone internal who will take the job for clout and let them in on the deal. I‚Äôm going to sell my shares for a massive profit and bounce when the company is starting to squeeze and then announce the merger once I‚Äôm free and clear. Just shut up and give the media and shareholders what they want (a plan that shows confidence and a clear set of goals but doesn‚Äôt fundamentally change the structure of the company or even mention a buyout or merger). The announcement will spike the price and you turds can sell your shares and leave with your comp plan after the acquisition.‚Äù

Hey, maybe it‚Äôs possible, but that‚Äôs pure speculation. We need something more concrete. What kind of thing should we expect? Here‚Äôs an idea: we should expect to see that insiders and company meeting-attenders who foresee that the company may still go bankrupt in the future would begin to sell or consider selling their positions in the company.

What did they do instead? 

They issued more shares, the only guaranteed way to reduce the value of each individual share already issued, and only the cfo sold anything meaningful and at a huge profit for himself. The price dropped immediately but then completely flatlined for days, even INTO A HOLIDAY WEEKEND, with negative price action only occurring with high volume trades. This is after they promised to maximize shareholder value and are legally bound in fact to do so.

Weird.

Here‚Äôs what really really gets me:

The relatively unknown executive Sue Gove is handed the EXPLICITLY TEMPORARY ceo position. Then she FUCKING YOLOS ALL HER PERSONAL MONEY INTO THE STOCK AND HASN‚ÄôT SOLD. What kind of person has enough faith in their unknown future replacement that they would put hundreds of thousands of dollars of their own money into the company? Especially if you know you aren‚Äôt keeping the position? I‚Äôll tell you.

She is a regular human being who is probably shitting her pants daily at being involved with the inside job these rich fucks are pulling off to turn this trash company into a hundreds of millions of dollars executive cash-out and her opportunity to get rich off of it as long as she stays quiet. 

She hasn‚Äôt sold. She wasn‚Äôt a multi-millionaire before. Her investment was up 5x when the stock hit $24 in August. She didn‚Äôt sell one share.

My two cents."

Homophobic MIL,pettyrevenge,996,x4vbux,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/x4vbux/homophobic_mil/,57,1662214169.0,"The post about homophobic mom at the wedding made me think of this story. My wife (36f) and I (35f) got married last year. My wife was kicked out of her parents house at 16 because she was a lesbian. Grew up in a very close-minded town and any girlfriend and even her ex wife were called her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù never acknowledged as a SO. 

Over time, with therapy, love, and support- my wife has started to mend relationships with my MIL and FIL. 

Fast forward to our wedding! My wife went out on a limb (would have previously never even entertained this thought due to the lack of relationship) and asked her mom to do a mother daughter dance with her to ‚ÄúMama‚Äù by Boys II Men. Her mother told her she felt it was inappropriate to slow dance with another woman that way and it made her really uncomfortable. Cue me wondering what kind of wedding she thinks she is attending but I digress!

Petty revenge was a 3-way dance with my wife, myself, and my mother who loves and accepts her to the exact same song. üòÇ

My wife also danced to another song with her aunt (MIL‚Äôs sister) who has always been super supportive of her. 

Her mom sat looking sooooo bothered the entire reception and some people were aware of the situation so she just looked like a total ignorant asshole. Her negative presence was overshadowed by the outpouring of love for my wife and I from everyone else, and it was the sweetest revenge!

ETA: thank you to everyone that has commented and reinforced that this is not okay. My wife and I have followed this through the day and while we know it was out of line of her mom, it is very nice and validating to have all you strangers co-signing!!! Thank you for the well wishes and we will ABSOLUTELY have a life of happiness as the ultimate revenge! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

I told my boyfriend when we first started dating that I didn't believe in marriage, so he shouldn't ask. Well... it's been 8 years now and I've come around on the idea, finally. It was so awkward- I told him, ""You remember how I told you not to propose? That I'd say no?"" And he nodded and I said, ""Well... if you ask. I'd say yes.""

His *face,* you guys. Shining like the sun! I didn't know how much he wanted to! He's always respected my boundaries, and never pressured me once, so I had no idea this was what he's wanted this whole time! And honestly, I appreciate it so much. He knew I had a lot of trauma to work through and he's given me space to do that, which makes me want to marry him even more.

He proposed on my birthday, and it was so lovely. Things have been so sweet between us since. 

Which leads us to yesterday night. I'm telling him how much I appreciate him, how, if I'm going to do something so scary, finally, I'm so glad it's with him. How I'm ready to face my fears. And he said-

""I never believed in love in first sight until I met you. I've known since I laid eyes on you that you were the woman I wanted to be with for the rest of my life."" After all the thanks, he asked me, ""Did you feel the same way?""

Ya'll. I am playing it over and over in my head. If I had hesitated for just ten damn seconds, maybe I could've said something artful? But without even missing a beat I said-

""Honestly, I thought you were too pretty to have a thought in your head. I wrote you off completely until we were talking at (a party months later!) and I realized you had some substance."" He pointed out that I had met him dozens of times between the night we first met, and the day I realized he wasn't an idiot... And because I wasn't at all thinking, I agreed! 

He's been laughing about it since but I wish I could crawl into the deepest hole I could find. There is definitely someone less damaged who deserves him more than me. 

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** Told my fiance he was too good-looking to be anything but a complete idiot. Then doubled down and told him he just didn't say anything intelligent for over a month in between our first meeting and when my opinion of him changed..."

So i was in the bathroom and i was having stomach issues so i was there for a while my sister knocked on the door and told me to give her a spray that was in there, I told her that i couldnt and for her to wait a little bit she then started yelling at me and flickering the lights this went on for a cupple of minutes until i was done then i opened the door and she called me a pig i then got mad and yelled at her saying ""dont call me a fucking pig"" she then punched me in my chest and yelled out DONT YELL NEACE IS SLEEPING i then punched her back and she grabbed me and almost threw me down the stairs then threw me on the ground and started chocking me i punched her again and my other sister 26F (who was here for the weekend) took her off of me

These are not issues relating to seasonality, just basic elements of the game. 

343 has their priorities completely wrong. It is clear that their goal is just to make money, not to make a fun game, which is a problem stemming from leadership. 

There needs to be a change in management at 343 to facilitate what the actual goal should be: finish game development. Then try to achieve seasonality. The game is **not** finished, and yet 343 are trying to fly before they‚Äôve even crawled."

# These ""FTDs"", are they in the room with us right now?

I'm going to keep this brief and get straight to the point, FTD's are very likely to be the cause of major runups in BBBY. FTD data will tell us that FTDs are resolved magically in their following trading days, but the experienced apes among us from the GME saga will know that firms like Shitadel and Suspecthana are masters at hiding FTD from cropping up. That why BBBY not being on RegSHO's Threshold List doesn't really matter.

Look at this chart, every runup big or small has always been after a major FTD Due Date. Each run occurs on average 3-5 trading days after when they become due, although the size of each run varies as they are also subject to fundamental factors like news.

[Yes I used MS Paint, sue me.](https://preview.redd.it/gfd343lflol91.png?width=1279&format=png&auto=webp&s=6233cbaffc18b3baa9efa83da4c38d1d12c286c9)

 

# We are wrong about T+35 (I think)

I'm sure most of us have seen this table below. I believe the T+35 Dates are wrong here.

[FTD Table from Chart Exchange](https://preview.redd.it/gcl6gasrlol91.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=c429da5ea76b5c2d44ba57b49cc36d7fb3efeb8e)

This is what T+35 actually means, taken from the SEC's website.

[Taken from https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/investor\/pubs\/regsho.htm](https://preview.redd.it/hdgj3llbmol91.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=317651dcd358ea8c6a7aec5f6f55615b108803b9)

So it's **35 Calendar Days** following the **TRADE DATE**, so looking at the table above, for the settlement date of 2022-08-12, there was a total of +293K new FTD's, and the T+35 date is stated to be 2022-09-16, however that's 35 Days after the **SETTLEMENT DATE**, not the **TRADE DATE**. Since we have T+2 settlement, the new FTD's from 12 Aug were actual fails from the trades made 2 trading days prior, which is 10 Aug. The table below shows the corrected T+35 Dates.

&#x200B;

|Settlement Date|Trade Date|Incorrect T+35 Date|Corrected T+35 Date|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2022-08-12|2022-08-10|2022-09-16|2022-09-14|
|2022-08-11|2022-08-09|2022-09-15|2022-09-13|
|2022-08-10|2022-08-08|2022-09-14|2022-09-12|
|2022-08-09|2022-08-05|2022-09-13|2022-09-09|
|2022-08-08|2022-08-04|2022-09-12|2022-09-08|

&#x200B;

# Why is this T+2 Important?

Because new FTD's generated are very correlated with the trading volume of that trade given date, not settlement date.

https://preview.redd.it/xg6v989irol91.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a6b23fc1cd530b03233c033938fefc2c75972f3

During the 4th-10th August run-up, New FTD's were approximately 0.49% of the trading volumes on those given trading days, during the 7th July spike ($BBBY closed +21.7%), new FTD's were as staggering \~4% of Trading Volume.

&#x200B;

# Looking Forward with Available FTD Data

The latest FTD data we have currently is up until the settlement date of 12th August, where we can see trades from the 4th of August to the 10th of August had generated \~1.6M new FTD's which start becoming due from 8th to 14th of September.

&#x200B;

|Trade Date|FTDs Created|T+35 Due Date|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2022-08-10|293,740|2022-09-14|
|2022-08-09|425,983|2022-09-13|
|2022-08-08|685,888|2022-09-12|
|2022-08-05|178,002|2022-09-09|
|2022-08-04|39,843|2022-09-08|

Adding them to the first chart, we get this

&#x200B;

[We can expect a runup from the 8th of September](https://preview.redd.it/ib80uqaeuol91.png?width=1279&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2c23ceaa1cb31cd0bb8f27f2758eef62a88918b)

 

# Here's where the fun begins

We know that new FTDs are closely correlated with trading volume, anywhere from \~0.5%, up to \~4% of trading volume. Since the latest FTD data doesn't cover the runup **from the 11th of August onwards**, lets take a look at what those FTDs might look like, using different percentages.

&#x200B;

**Low Estimate: FTDs are 0.5% of Trading Volume**

[0.5&#37; of Trading Volume Fail to Deliver](https://preview.redd.it/g3rspjj1xol91.png?width=1481&format=png&auto=webp&s=e13ff494c3a6303e59def88c0120dc78c0f64d90)

&#x200B;

**Moderate Estimate: FTDs are 1% of Trading Volume**

[1&#37; of Trading Volume Fail to Deliver](https://preview.redd.it/hx4qa9g2xol91.png?width=1481&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ca424f9dd1af7c24bb2efa36a7dedd8e5b56115)

&#x200B;

**High Estimate: FTDs are 3% of Trading Volume**

[3&#37; of Trading Volume Fail to Deliver](https://preview.redd.it/p7x7jki3xol91.png?width=1481&format=png&auto=webp&s=095643bf1bfd0902d81cf9c0baa53bf3235efe16)

Even if a meager 0.5% of Trading Volume become FTDs from 11 Aug onwards, we are looking at a pretty sizeable runup. At 1%, the potential run-up looks to be roughly twice the size of the Aug 15 spike. At 3%, the Aug 15 looks like a bad joke.

I think am a victim of cybercrime. I got tangled in a potential mess by sexting with a girl on video. I think she used playbacks but I'm not sure, she talked through the entire thing. Anyway, we did the thing on video and I think this is going to be one of those scandal for ransom cases. Best case scenario the video(of me beating my meat XD) gets released to shady porn sites, worst case scenario the video be used as a blackmail material for ransom. Anyway, the account blocked me so I don't know where this goes. I guess I'll wait till my notifications blow up and I'm at the center of the issue haha wish me luck. 

TL;DR: Beat my meat on cam to a fraud girl, currently waiting for the notifications to flood"

My scary experience with a Smart Motorway is enough to know they're dumb AF. Anyone else experienced problems with them?,CasualUK,830,x4xif0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/x4xif0/my_scary_experience_with_a_smart_motorway_is/,247,1662219964.0,"Last week I was driving down the M4 and my car died, not just a little either, it was a full on EMP style mega bomb of a breakdown. The engine cut off as I was in the 3rd lane (sods law), I tried to restart it but it wasn't playing ball. Not long after (I'd started to signal at this point) the lights died, completely. In the space of a few seconds I went from driving and listening to Pink Floyd to having to use actual Moonlight in order to see where the hell the ""hard shoulder but not a hard shoulder"" was. I stopped, shat myself, got out and immediately rung the RAC. This was at stupid o'clock in the morning so there was shit-all traffic. Whilst I was on hold though, Captain Juggernaut comes along. Only just sees me and brakes slam on, followed by a swerve. Doesn't stop, just honks and carries on driving. I think ""Well, fuck me"". Does it happen again? Of COURSE it does. 2 cars in the space of a few minutes do the same. Bare in mind my lights are completely out. There's no gantry anywhere that's obviously registered I'm in the lane so they can put ""Twat in a Hyundai"" on the lane block sign thingy. After that, thankfully, no near smashy smash potatoes for myself.   


(The car's still in the garage, battery exploded).   


I saw shit like this coming a mile off, not the black Hyundai in the ""hard shoulder but not a hard shoulder"", but of course similar. And those refuge areas? Jesus, unless your car can do 0-60mp in 2 seconds, good luck pulling out of one of them safely. I've got a micropenis and it's vastly larger than a Smart Motorway slip lane."

Men have no idea how dangerous the world can be for women and how cautious we have to be,TwoXChromosomes,1904,x4rfch,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/x4rfch/men_have_no_idea_how_dangerous_the_world_can_be/,259,1662201800.0,"I asked why Uber drivers lock their doors and got told I was crazy and stupid. 

Men have no idea how we have to be cautious at all times. I‚Äôd love to go through life without a care in the world but unfortunately if we aren‚Äôt cautious we risk being hurt. From a young age we‚Äôre taught to:

* Never leave your drink unattended when you‚Äôre out. If you have to go to the bathroom, buy another even if your friends watched it. 

* Don‚Äôt walk alone at night. If you have to - walk with a friend or pretend you‚Äôre on a phone call. 

* If you see another woman who looks uncomfortable with a man who won‚Äôt leave her alone, pretend you know her so she can leave without fear of being hurt. 

* Hold your car keys in your hands between your fingers when walking to your car so if someone tries to grab you, rake the key across their skin. 

* Carry pepper spray. Never try to use a knife with self defence because a man can easily overpower you. 

* My self defence teacher said if all other methods have failed try to pee or shit yourself if someone is trying to rape you. Hopefully they get disgusted and stop. 

* Don‚Äôt have someone pick you up and don‚Äôt go to someone‚Äôs house for your first date. Make sure it‚Äôs in a public place so you can easily leave if things go sideways. 

* Don‚Äôt have your Uber driver drop you off at your actual address. If someone is following you, walk into someone‚Äôs front yard and pretend it‚Äôs your house until they‚Äôve gone away. 

* Cross the street if it‚Äôs dark and there is a man or group of men. 

* Try to avoid areas that are secluded. Take the long way home - walk on the main street where there are businesses, people, security cameras and lights. 

* Never fall asleep in a taxi or Uber. Don‚Äôt sit in the front seat. Share the location of your Uber. Tell your friend when you‚Äôve made it home safely & do the same for them. 

* Most importantly - follow your gut. If something feels off, be ready to call for help or go home. 

1 in 3 women are sexually or physically assaulted in their life. Thinking a woman is stupid or crazy for being cautious is completely oblivious and naive.


We consciously and subconsciously protect ourselves in countless ways. Unfortunately it‚Äôs necessary. Those are the safety tips I could think of from the top of my head although I‚Äôd love to hear more. 

As a woman, what do you do to stay safe?

Edit: Statistically you‚Äôre more likely to be hurt by a friend or boyfriend - someone you know rather than a stranger. Recognising red flags is also important.

Edit 2: men‚Äôs safety is important, sure. But this post is about women needing to protect ourselves from men. 

If you‚Äôd like to comment ‚Äúas a man‚Äù then maybe you could talk about things you or your friends could do to so we don‚Äôt need these precautions."

Tolkien's themes are already deeply embedded in this show.,LOTR_on_Prime,244,x54grk,https://www.reddit.com/r/LOTR_on_Prime/comments/x54grk/tolkiens_themes_are_already_deeply_embedded_in/,73,1662238247.0,"Even after the first two episodes, it's clear that some of the key themes that define much of Tolkien's work--about the struggle to accept death and mortality, loss and change; about power and its uses; about standing up and uniting against the darkness--are already central to the lives of the main characters. 

* Many of the Elven characters are having trouble grasping concepts like death, change, and the passage of time. Elrond doesn't understand how long twenty years has been for a mortal Dwarf like Durin--that Durin has been through many important events and life changes in what Elrond sees as a relatively short time. Robert Aramayo does a great job of conveying Elrond's pain and regret when he realizes how he's let down his friend.

* The Elves in the Southlands still see the humans of Tir-Harad as the same people who served Morgoth a thousand years ago. For the humans, it's been dozens of generations--it's literally ancient history. They've changed, and the never-changing elves don't understand this.

* Galadriel grew up in Valinor, and expected that she and everyone she ever loved would life forever. Now her life is defined by death, a concept she didn't even have a word for before, and she's still struggling to deal with grief and loss.

* Because of this, Galadriel is committed to stamping out all the remnants of Morgoth's evil. But like the rulers that Gandalf confronted with news of Sauron's rise in The Lord of the Rings, Gil-Galad isn't ready to stand up to the darkness. He's afraid that hunting down Sauron and his forces will provoke them, and start a war he's not prepared to fight.

* Like Gil-Galad, Marigold Brandyfoot doesn't want to think about the possibility of trouble in faraway lands. She tells Nori that the troubles of the wider world aren't the Harfoots' problem--that if they stick with their own kind, they'll be safe. She believes the Harfoots are free precisely because they have no power or possessions that can be taken away.

* Celebrimbor, on the other hand, wants more of both. He gets a real Feanorian glint in his eye when he starts talking about creating works of real POWER. He wants the greatest forge ever built, and he wants it now--and if there's one thing we know from Tolkien's work, it's that creative hubris and outsized industrial ambitions rarely end badly for anyone.

This show feels very Tolkien to me, and not just in its visual style. These are the sort of questions and concepts Tolkien put into a lot of his work, and it's clear that this show is finding new ways to explore them. And if you know what's coming, you know that these exact questions, and how various characters deal with them, will define the history of Middle-earth for the rest of the Second Age."

Conflicted With (New) Destiny.,Destiny,126,x592w9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/x592w9/conflicted_with_new_destiny/,62,1662250981.0,"I've been watching destiny since around 2018 or 19. At the time I would have called myself a conservative or libertarian. A big reason why I shifted toward liberalism/the left is because of destiny, his arguments guided me down a path that made me a true omni liberal. 

A big debate that destiny had that shifted my way of thinking was when he talked to ABL or Anthony Brian Logan. A big reason destiny was able to convert me was because of how hard he dunked on ABL.  I saw this ""dunking"" become less frequent after the whole Kyle Rittenhouse debate with Vaush. He dunked hard on Vaush, making him bite very silly bullets.     

Destiny and his way of engaging with people has changed, not his personality but more so his way of engaging with people has changed a little in my perspective.  I think his Twitch  ban made him reflect and change. He is a lot less hard on people/ less of a ""debate bro."" I would argue though that he has lost a vital piece of what made him special.   

This brings me to Mr. girl. I will say that Destiny is  not a liar or at least not purposely. I think him and  Max have fundamentally different ways of perceiving the world. Mr. Girl would never publicly eat lunch/breakfast with Nick, broadcast it live, mainly because of how he views the harmfulness of nicks ideology.         

Max literally thinks Nick is Hitler or someone who would do things similar to Hitler if given the power to do those things.  I actually think old Destiny that debated ABL would do that same thing. I don't think he would want to go on a lunch stream with ABL. I don't think ABL  is as bad as lets say Nick. I just think that not pushing back against  Nicks views as hard as he did with ABL makes Nicks views seem more normal. 

Max is not telling Destiny to call Nick a Nazi, he is just asking him to be more careful and not be buddy buddy with a person (publicly) that you think have demonstrably terrible views of the world.  If I were a Nick viewer I don't think new destiny would convince me to switch my views, old destiny would. I know because he did change me. I am speaking from my own experience.  

Now more than ever, especially after Mr. Girl  got banned and there is at least some evidence pointing to the fact that Nicks fans may have been responsible for his ban.  I think destiny should ask that Nick tell his fans to not mass report MR.Girl and if he refuses to do so then I don't think he should talk to Nick anymore. I think a lot of people have burned brigades with Destiny and fucked him over.  I just think that MR.Girl has been nothing but nice to Destiny  and I think if he continues to hang with Nick  and platform him without nick making a post or video condemning his fans to mass report MR.Girl is a disservice to MR.Girl."

From sexually harassing talents to hate speech towards Ayame, OKBH are infamous for one thing: being nuisances. They add nothing towards to the community whilst actively making this subreddit and the community as a whole degrade towards 4chan level hatred and degeneracy.

They hide all of this beneath a thin veneer of ""irony,"" but just like all ironic subreddits they eventually stop being ironic entirely.

The recent hate towards Ayame (for taking a break after her grandmother died and her mother got cancer) is so far beyond excessive that it has entered the realm of straight up evil.

In my opinion the members of OKBH should be banned from this subreddit. Their subreddit should also be removed.

I would not blame the talents if they never use this subreddit again.

I don't blame the moderators for this, T-chan has done a wonderful job, but I think it has simply become more than one or two people can handle.

Peace, Robmart"

This post comes with a disclaimer in an effort to combat misinformation.

***disclaimer:*** *There was a lot of interesting information yesterday posted here today; Ortex guy revealed that DTC was at an all time high, cost to borrow spiking, and yours truly; (Me) published made a post that 3.4k uproots and received a quarter million views. so first of all... thank you...*

*But before I get into the details; let me make something very very clear.*

***I am NOT so egotistical as to ASSUME that my post is being covered up.***

*I am merely following up on a rather interesting coincidence please keep in mind; I do not have the time to investigate the origin of every dog post on this board today... So take what I am about to say with a grain of salt...*

*with that in mind...*

Lets get out our tin-foil hats! Because I'm going full Alex-Jones!

I bet you noticed that this board looks suspiciously simmilar to your Facebook feeds this morning. We got flooded with pictures of Puppies, cats, and even a corn-dog for some reason. And chances are one of you lovely apes posted a picture of your dog to this board to get in on the phenomenon.

If you have. First off your dog/cat/iguana/corndog is absolutely ADORABLE üòç I love him/her and he/she/ is undeniably a good boy/girl and/or delicious!)

But I did not updoot, or comment on your post.

Why not?

Simple; because our fine wrinkly brained Apes are spending hours slaving over their sticky keyboards to publish the DD and Original Memes that this community needs!

Upvoting or commenting on that one random corndog post potentially plays into directly into the hedgie's hand **and you could be unknowingly contributing to a counter intelligence technique called TOPIC DILUTION.**

# What is Topic Dilution?

*To paraphrase this* [*Safe Net*](https://safenetforum.org/t/the-gentleperson-s-guide-to-forum-spies/30059) *article*

""Topic dilution is a **forum-sliding** technique that is very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause **'RESOURCE BURN.'** By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt the forum readers **they are effectively stopped from anything resembling any real productivity.**

If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching **and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.'**

In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. **The less informed they are, the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that the attacker desires the group to go in.**

How a sudden influx of dog pictures creates a 'Forum Slide'

*To again paraphrase this* [*Safe Net*](https://safenetforum.org/t/the-gentleperson-s-guide-to-forum-spies/30059) *article*

If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by **‚Äòforum sliding.‚Äô** In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to ‚Äòage.‚Äô Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a **‚Äòforum slide.‚Äô**

**The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist,** which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public.

To trigger a ‚Äòforum slide‚Äô and **‚Äòflush‚Äô the critical post out of public view** it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then ‚Äòreplying‚Äô to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. **This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting ‚Äòslides‚Äô down the front page, and quickly out of public view.**

**Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and useless posts.** By this means, the attacker effectively keeps the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.

# Now I'm not Jealous... but...

**THIS IS HOW A FUCKING CORN DOG GETS MORE UPDOOTS THAN ME!!! üí¢üò°üò†**

>!Okay fine... I'm a little jealous...!<

Now to reiterate a point from my disclaimer. I am not some salty neck-beard that is here to Karen-post because **MY** moment in the spotlight is over.

I ask that you remain mindful that It's entirely possible my post had nothing to do with todays forum-sliding attack. Or that we just slipped into **'Gossip-Mode'** simply because the markets closed today; and were just a bunch of smooth brained ape.

But potentially Hundreds of Billions of dollars are at stake here...

I assure you... **the wriggliest of corporate weasels are working tirelessly day and night** **to control the narrative!** We need to be aware of this as a community. And the be mindful that your fellow Ape, might just be a weasel.

Here's how we starve the Weasel!

* Do not feed them; If you see 'gossip posting' don't comment, don't up-doot. This keeps DD on the front page so its author can get that sweet-sweet dopamine hit form well-deserved updoots.
* If Multiple Apes are Gossip Posting with dog pictures. Start a centralized Dog Thread; Encourage others to comment with pet pictures instead of creating a separate post.
* If there is already a grand pet thread that is popular today; Comment on the pet-post to encourage the OP to move to the relevant board.
* If you feel that your DD or important post was obfuscated by form sliding; please comment below. If there is validity to your claim it may help the wrinkle brains determine if there is a pattern. (Please include the date of occurrence and as much information as possible.)
* Report fake accounts when you see them; this effectively disarms the weasel!
* Stay vigilant, stay skeptical, stay informed, and keep holding... You beautiful fucking smooth brain!

Also the ilvl of the jewels for sale is always 33, 55, 68, 75, or 83, which makes it clear this is true.  I think prices are probably artificially high because there isn't enough awareness of this.

One thing of note is that there actually seem to be more ilvl 33 jewels than any other type.  So probably there are people doing dedicated runs of normal lab to find these jewels.

For anyone who has done enough runs to have an idea of the drop rate, what has your experience been so far?  I'm in SSF and haven't found any yet but I'm wondering how big of a waste of time going for this would be."

Call grandma and tell her why it's important to you, offer to drive her and anyone else, if you can. Talk to people tell them why this is important to you. 

Most importantly, do not miss the deadline to register to vote. Texas requires a final step, a signed printed document MAILED in before October 11th. 

Abbott has to go. Abortion must be legal. Abortion is Healthcare.

They refused to pay my PTO unless I signed a letter agreement stating I would not slander the owner management group. Denied my unemployment till a ALJ determined it was a wrongful termination.
So I left a review on Google about some of the business practices like refusing to move a guest when there was sewage backed up causing headaches. Altering time punches to not exceed 40 hours. Promoting a hostile environment.
All things that are true, backed by emails, photos, audio and video recordings. Not slander. But the ownership group denies any of it and had their lawyers send me a cesse and desist letter threatening a lawsuit, demanding I delete the review.
Im not deleting anything and doubled down by making some videos public on YouTube.

I've contacted a couple lawyers myself but $400 consultation fee is much for me.  
Not my intent to slander or ""harm"" their business, rather let people know what goes on there. 
Wish me luck."

But if that's true, why does Genshin fail so badly at something essential like providing some kind of playability options for the story tied to events outside of their specific duration, or at least any good way to experience that portion of the story in game without having to play the event?  
  
These story segments provide essential character development for characters such as Fischl, Mona, Albedo and others, do Genshin devs just not care if people end up missing those segments for one reason or another?

But why has it been trending so much? What's with the cock edits and Kanye music and Patrick Fabian? And most importantly, what's the actual joke? I mean, I was at a college football game yesterday and someone in the crowd shouted ""The One Piece is real"". I never hear anyone talk about One Piece in public unless its some school club or something. What's going on?"

[This](https://i.imgur.com/DEgjc6J.png) goddamned chicken mushroom is a deprived creature.

So before I expound why, a little lesson in mycology. Mushrooms reproduce by releasing spores, these spores are then carried by the wind and spread all over the place. When conditions are right, they germinate and a new mushroom is born.

Now, let's go back to Mr. Cockshroom here.

Remember what happens when you electrocute this humongous cock? Yeah, it can't help but shiver in delight. We even get a meter showing how close it is to climax. And then BOOM:

https://i.imgur.com/WGHa7oC.jpeg

Spores in the air!

But not just any ordinary type of spore, they're meat-seeking missiles designed to track any creature with a pulse.

Imagine being an electro user battling this fungal feathered fiend for a while, thinking you're doing damage because it looks like it's in pain, then suddenly you find yourself on the receiving end of its ~~sperm~~ spore swarm.

Then if you manage to survive that, you are treated to its [post-nut slumber](https://i.imgur.com/qvQi3UP.jpeg) where it doesn't care if you kill it or not. It's too satisfied to give another fuck.

Just look at how proud this perv is. Look at it:

Coming into the CBLOL playoffs as 4th seed, LOUD put up a performance by taking down the top 3 teams in playoffs. After beating RED the 2nd seed and losing to PNG who had taken down FURIA the 1st seed, LOUD had a tough road ahead in which they had to beat both FUR and PNG in back to back series. Seemingly struck by the 'lower bracket buff' they sweep in back to back series, allowing them to lift the trophy and go to Worlds!

LLL will first head to the Play-In stage where they'll look to reach the hights of CBLOL teams of old times and make it to groups!

Congrats to the players and the org!

I'm sitting here trying to think of a new build to create, and at every turn I think ***""Well I need to figure out a way to fit some MF in there, or I'll have to get a culler/accidently kill a God-Touched mob and it will feel bad...""***

It just makes the overall process of creating a new build daunting and absolutely not fun...The fear of missing out on a stack of 4-5+ divines because I'm not playing a 100% IIQ 600% IIR build is giving me total paralysis, I lose the motivation to even start something new.

It was fine in Diablo 2 because gear that had MF on it was also **VERY** powerful. Our MF gear is a lvl 10 pair of gloves with 5 added lightning damage to attacks and some boots with 10% movement speed...

**Either buff and create new powerful uniques for Magic Finding, or CULL Magic Find altogether.**

Thank you for coming to my rant."

My manager publicly announced that my nipples were visible at work yesterday. Is this sexual harassment?,antiwork,4012,x4tnr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/x4tnr5/my_manager_publicly_announced_that_my_nipples/,541,1662209361.0,"I‚Äôve been working at this place (large amusement park, big company, several parks across the country, none in Florida) for about 5 months. I am disabled and my service dog comes to work with me, and have previously had some issues with them accommodating my disability, despite being told when I was hired that it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem to accommodate me. It hadn‚Äôt been a problem up until a month or so ago, when all the students who work there went back to school. Recently, I‚Äôve upset some managers for reminding them I can‚Äôt work outdoors, because they kept going against my accommodations and putting me at outdoor placements. I bring this up, because I feel as if I‚Äôm being targeted because they are irritated about having to accommodate my disability, and I have had to remind them for my last 5 or so shifts that I can‚Äôt work outside. I guess me being disabled is a real inconvenience for them. 

So, yesterday, I was at work, and I suppose my nipples were visible through my work shirt. I did not notice this myself. My two managers pulled me into an open doorway in front of my coworkers to inform me that a customer had complained that my nipples were visible, and that I needed to wear ‚Äúan appropriate bra‚Äù to work. I was wearing a bra, but I was too upset to tell them this, and just said okay. They told me it was a uniform violation and if they were visible again, I‚Äôd get written up. 

I went into the bathroom afterwards, crying because I was embarrassed, and immediately took a photo of the top half of my uniform. My nipples were not visible at that time. I told a male coworker, who pointed out that his nipples were almost always visible through the tight work shirt, and no one‚Äôs ever said anything to him about it. 

Is this sexual harassment? My family thinks they might be targeting me because of my disability, and thinks that they‚Äôre trying to get me to quit, due to the other recent interactions I‚Äôve had with them.

EDIT: because people seem confused, no flesh of the nipple (or breast) was visible. They could (apparently) see the outline of my nipple through my work shirt and bra.

In the employee handbook, there is zero mention of nipples or even bras. It only says that ‚Äúappropriate undergarments must be worn‚Äù and ‚Äúwaistbands and undergarments may not be visible‚Äù"

Proof the DTCC Committed ‚ÄúInternational Securities Fraud‚Äù?,Superstonk,4158,x4uv9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x4uv9m/proof_the_dtcc_committed_international_securities/,421,1662212904.0,"Post it if you have it, because all I have seen are the clarification from GameStop and the clarification from one of the EU regulators. What I have not seen, despite the constant bombardment of memes and citations of ‚ÄúDTCC committed international securities fraud‚Äù, is evidence from a broker that they were instructed by the DTCC to break the law. You know, something that would stand up in court?

So where the fuck is it? I‚Äôm asking over a month later, because despite my being on here hours at a time each day, and politely asking the mods for clarification on the ‚Äúevidence‚Äù, it seems there is none. So post some and help a brother out.

Otherwise we should stop accusing them of fraud (as much as I want to fuck them over like they have me). Let‚Äôs be fair, rational, and always ask questions. Especially if accusations require evidence.

Thank you and have a great weekend üíú

Edit 1: great conversation. Still lots of misdirection, FUD, gaslighting and ad hominem bullshit to sift through. There is one gem below, which looks promising. I‚Äôm currently trying to research FC02 v FC06, ~~and if it should be FC06 and this screenshot on Twitter can be validated and verified somehow, it does look like legal evidence~~.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x4uv9m/proof\_the\_dtcc\_committed\_international\_securities/imy68td/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x4uv9m/proof_the_dtcc_committed_international_securities/imy68td/)

Edit 3: [This thread marked as possible DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/whup7y/clearing_up_the_recent_misinformation_about_the/) and not debunked by mods, states that FC-02 is correct. If that is the case, the link above is incorrect on the FC-02 bit, but does show the ""Stock split"" portion. ~~So I'm still looking for~~ Would this evidence ~~that would~~ stand up in court?  Something that shows the DTCC fraudulently instructed brokers to unknowingly or not, to commit crime. [u/sharkopotamus](https://www.reddit.com/user/sharkopotamus/) says that *""As you can see, the function code is correct (FC 02), but the Processed As field is incorrect. Processed As should have been ""Stock Dividend,"" instead of ""Stock Split.""""*  **So we are looking for documents that support FC02 + ""Stock Split"" or anything that is FC06.** Good stuff fam.

Edit 2: I was thinking, the more you see ‚Äúthe DTCC has committed fraud‚Äù the more likely you are to accept it as fact, and move on. The less likely you are to continue digging for evidence.

Edit 4: clarifications

However with archnemesis rares, those hiccups and problems are actually much bigger and longer and stay in some form until you're killing maven and uber elder when you're able to completely brute force through any of the problems the rares might present.

I have leveled 5 characters to maps this league, this isn't because i am having so much fun that i tore through 5 characters in two weeks but because i have abandoned every single one of them because the awkward part of build progression never seemed to go away, the first character i made felt so awful that i spent all the currency i had gotten up to that point to respec it into a poison shield crush build which worked for a while but even with that and being in red maps, i still get at least one rare with 2+ modifiers that counter me and i get annoyed and feel a sudden urge to just stop playing for the day.

After dropping that build because i didn't want to play a build that made me want to stop playing at least once a map i leveled a frostblot ice nova elementalist, hoping to deal with some of the annoyance by freezing the rares but i only did 10 maps on that build because at least 2 or 3 times per map i would encounter a rare that was moving at light speed that wouldn't get frozen for whatever reason and i was forced to try and kill a rare 10 times tankier than the boss of the map i was in while kiting it on a frost bolt ice nova build without much cast speed investment. in the end i dropped that build because now i was wanting to stop playing the game 5 times a map instead of once.

The build that i have most recently brought to maps is a boneshatter slayer hoping to deal with the game with great sustain and consistent stuns but of course because i didn't have enough damage and attack speed, most of the time i simply wouldn't stun rares or they would bulldoze me before i even finished my first swing to even attempt to stun it or leech from it.

I know there are builds that have less problems with these kinds of things but i simply happen to be uninterested in those builds and i absolutely could have optimized a ton of things to make the process go more smoothly but I simply disagree that i should have to work so hard to feel good in white maps, white maps should be the dock for new builds entering mapping, very easy to clear with almost no investment so that you can get your foot in the door and start upgrading your gear."

# Kyivskyi Cake

[Kyivskyi Cake in its natural habitat.](https://preview.redd.it/ajinnau2zql91.png?width=1707&format=png&auto=webp&s=359d5466ac053ab773b8f8708c4e7bcd1f8dacc2)

This super famous crispy-yet-airy nut cake is an unforgettable dessert.  It is a masterpiece of texture and balance, and a delightfully sweet business card of the capital of Ukraine. 

The peculiarity of the Kyivskyi Cake is that the cake is made of fermented egg white meringue, which gives the cake a special feel and taste. There is a legend that in 1956, employees at the Karl Marx Kyiv Confectionary Factory forgot to put the egg whites in the refrigerator for the night.  The next day they discovered that the whites fermented because they were left in a warm kitchen. They did not want to get in trouble, so they used the whites anyway. They needed to come up with something, so they baked a cake and the result was very impressive and this is how the famous Kyivskyi Cake was born. Others though, strongly believe that this cake was invented by chefs after painstaking and long experimentation. 

Regardless of the origin story, this cake soon became the absolute culinary and cultural phenomenon that continues to this day.

[Luscious cross-section of Kyivskyi Cake.  NSFW.](https://preview.redd.it/15rlf4agzql91.png?width=3504&format=png&auto=webp&s=52ca9dd947e3f2d2f6cf16c2ab70f1b4cc45a62d)

During the times of the USSR this cake was not easy to buy.  Even if you could afford it, it was available only in Kyiv and you had to queue at 4 in the morning!  There were (true) stories about people coming to Kyiv with empty suitcases just to fill them with Kyivskyi Cakes to bring them back to their hometowns.  It was a funny sight but it wasn't that long ago that, at Kyiv train and bus stations, travelers (including me!) would be walking around with easily recognized cake boxes containing Kyivskyi cake.

Today many different culinary factories and bakeries make their own version, yet the market is never saturated enough - even today if you want to ensure you get one you should make your way to a factory store in the morning!

**Quick note:** If you‚Äôre not into baking, you can likely purchase the classic version of the cake, still made in the same factory by the Roshen Corporation (the largest confectioner in Ukraine, and owned/named after former President Petro Po**roshen**ko), at an international foods store near you, especially if you live in a medium to large sized city.  If not, they are widely available to ship directly to you from speciality distributors online after a quick google search.

So let‚Äôs start the journey! 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Recipe

**Warning!  This recipe is NOT easy comfort food like the other recipes we‚Äôve shared in this series - this one is seriously high effort!  Even in the world of cakes, this is not such a straightforward one.  But it is extremely rewarding to enjoy your Kyivskyi Cake after such an effort!**

[Very nutty homemade Kyivskyi Cake!](https://preview.redd.it/bvm8qeil2ql91.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=7358414cf3238c87cec60a392d4a27801f830af7)

**Ingredients**

Cake: 

* Egg whites to ferment - 200g (need 6-7 eggs depending on size)
* Flour - 45g
* Sugar - 240g
* Vanila - to taste
* Roasted cashews and/or hazelnuts - 150g

Frosting:

* Medium-sized egg - 1
* Softened butter - 250g
* Milk - 150ml
* Sugar - 150g
* Brandy or Cognac - 1 tbsp
* Cocoa powder - 10g
* Vanilla - to taste
* Food dyes - for decoration

**DAY 1**

1. On the first day you need to ferment the egg whites. Separate the whites from the yolks -  and don‚Äôt let a single drop of the yolk get into the bowl with the whites!
2. Place the egg whites in a CLEAN glass bowl or jar, cover and leave for 12-24 hours at room temperature. How do you know that egg whites successfully fermented?  The liquid will become thicker and you will see bubbles have formed in it. Thanks to this fermentation process, the meringue will become more stable and easier to handle.

**DAY 2**

**On the second day, the cake is baked!**

1. First, you can prepare the nuts. It is best to use cashews, but hazelnuts will also work, or a mix. Dry the nuts in a pan (no oil is needed),  
2. Grind them into small, but not too small pieces. They can be chopped in the blender or by hand with a knife or a rolling pin. Set aside about 2 tablespoons of nuts for decoration. 
3. Mix the remaining nuts with sifted flour and 40 g of granulated sugar. Set this mixture aside.
4. Turn on the oven to heat up to 150¬∞C and prepare 2 baking cake pans by lining the pans with baking paper (no need to grease). 
5. Now you can start whipping the whites. First, beat the fermented egg whites at low speeds - the mass should be saturated with air, becoming lush and cloudy. Without stopping the mixer, add vanilla essence and add 200g of sugar (gradually). Continue beating for another 5 minutes, until you can form stiff peaks. 
6. Add the mixture of nuts and flour to the meringue - in 3-4, in portions. Use a spatula and be gentle!
7. Pour the batter into baking pans, level with a spatula and immediately put it in the oven heated to 140-150¬∞C.  It is best to bake all layers at once, but if there is only one baking pan, then you need to divide the whites into two parts and whip them one at a time as whipped meringue cannot sit for a long time. 
8. Bake for 2 hours. Do not open the door all this time so that the meringue does not collapse. The cake layers should be well-dried and beige in color. After baking, the cakes should be left in the baking pan for a day in the oven or in a dry place to let the layers properly settle and strengthen. 

**DAY 3**

**On the third day, the cake is assembled!**

1. Firstly, remove the cakes from the baking pans. Tip: run a knife along the edge, turn the mold upside down, tap and the cake will come out easily.  If the layers are not even, carefully cut off the unevenness with the knife. You can use these bits and scraps by crumbling them and mixing them with remaining nuts set aside for decoration.
2. Now let‚Äôs make the frosting:  Pour milk into a saucepan, add sugar and vanilla, mix well and then add an egg.  Place it on a  low heat and, while stirring constantly, bring to a boil, and cook for 4-5 minutes. The final consistency should match the consistency of condensed milk. Leave to cool to room temperature.
3. Whip the room temperature butter for two minutes and gradually add the mixture of milk and egg. The cream should be airy. 
4. Pour a little bit of brandy or cognac in and briefly beat again. Set aside a little bit for decorations (if you wish, add dye to make it colorful).
5. Spread cream on the bottom cake - no more than 2/3 of the entire volume will be covered with cream.
6. Add cocoa powder to the rest of the cream, and beat with a mixer again, just enough to mix in the cocoa powder.  Use it to spread the cream on the top and sides of the cake. 
7. Sprinkle the sides with the mix of nuts and crumbles. On the edges of the top of the cake, make a border of chocolate cream.  Decorate as your heart desires, go wild!  Traditionally, this cake is decorated with chestnut tree leaves and flowers, as the chestnut is everywhere in Kyiv and is emblematic of the city. 

**DAY 4**

1. Put the cake in the refrigerator, preferably overnight. The longer it sits, the tastier it will become as the flavors have a chance to infuse. Also, the cake will remain crispy but will be slightly soaked with cream so it will be much easier to cut.
2. EAT IT!  Preferably with black tea or a nice strong cup of coffee - and with friends or family.

BBBY is in for a major run up says my highly regarded analysis.,wallstreetbets,891,x52m7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x52m7o/bbby_is_in_for_a_major_run_up_says_my_highly/,437,1662233205.0,"# These ""FTDs"", are they in the room with us right now?

I'm going to keep this brief and get straight to the point, FTD's are very likely to be the cause of major runups in BBBY. FTD data will tell us that FTDs are resolved magically in their following trading days, but the experienced apes among us from the GME saga will know that firms like Shitadel and Suspecthana are masters at hiding FTD from cropping up. That why BBBY not being on RegSHO's Threshold List doesn't really matter.

Look at this chart, every runup big or small has always been after a major FTD Due Date. Each run occurs on average 3-5 trading days after when they become due, although the size of each run varies as they are also subject to fundamental factors like news.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iaj0cb6fkpl91.png?width=1279&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc6fee563b52b8ca4ae1c126c7a91d8940cd1301

# We are wrong about T+35 (I think)

I'm sure most of us have seen this table below. I believe the T+35 Dates are wrong here.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/09jxyjrgkpl91.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d7962369223936b665c27364885b9eea5cd0c9c

This is what T+35 actually means, taken from the SEC's website.

[ Taken from https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/investor\/pubs\/regsho.htm](https://preview.redd.it/g1p1dm5ikpl91.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fe5a1800c9fca4e39009ba1b8d0eff2fa5bd975)

So it's **35 Calendar Days** following the **TRADE DATE**, so looking at the table above, for the settlement date of 2022-08-12, there was a total of +293K new FTD's, and the T+35 date is stated to be 2022-09-16, however that's 35 Days after the **SETTLEMENT DATE**, not the **TRADE DATE**. Since we have T+2 settlement, the new FTD's from 12 Aug were actual fails from the trades made 2 trading days prior, which is 10 Aug. The table below shows the corrected T+35 Dates.

&#x200B;

|Settlement Date|Trade Date|Incorrect T+35 Date|Corrected T+35 Date|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2022-08-12|2022-08-10|2022-09-16|2022-09-14|
|2022-08-11|2022-08-09|2022-09-15|2022-09-13|
|2022-08-10|2022-08-08|2022-09-14|2022-09-12|
|2022-08-09|2022-08-05|2022-09-13|2022-09-09|
|2022-08-08|2022-08-04|2022-09-12|2022-09-08|

&#x200B;

# Why is this T+2 Important?

Because new FTD's generated are very correlated with the trading volume of that trade given date, not settlement date.

https://preview.redd.it/uf1etpukkpl91.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=3617178e63553c76279fcd1ce49203955b46ef3f

During the 4th-10th August run-up, New FTD's were approximately 0.49% of the trading volumes on those given trading days, during the 7th July spike ($BBBY closed +21.7%), new FTD's were as staggering \~4% of Trading Volume.

&#x200B;

# Looking Forward with Available FTD Data

The latest FTD data we have currently is up until the settlement date of 12th August, where we can see trades from the 4th of August to the 10th of August had generated \~1.6M new FTD's which start becoming due from 8th to 14th of September.

|Trade Date|FTDs Created|T+35 Due Date|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2022-08-10|293,740|2022-09-14|
|2022-08-09|425,983|2022-09-13|
|2022-08-08|685,888|2022-09-12|
|2022-08-05|178,002|2022-09-09|
|2022-08-04|39,843|2022-09-08|

&#x200B;

Adding them to the first chart, we get this

[ We can expect a move up from the 8th of September](https://preview.redd.it/5133nr6okpl91.png?width=1279&format=png&auto=webp&s=917565d895de7a63cdcf53e4b66b0cb24356359d)

Doesn't look like much, but stay with me.

&#x200B;

# Here's where the fun begins

We know that new FTDs are closely correlated with trading volume, anywhere from \~0.5%, up to \~4% of trading volume. Since the latest FTD data doesn't cover the runup **from the 11th of August onwards**, lets take a look at what those FTDs might look like, using different percentages.

&#x200B;

**Low Estimate: FTDs are 0.5% of Trading Volume**

[ 0.5&#37; of Trading Volume Fail to Deliver](https://preview.redd.it/ds153gkpkpl91.png?width=1481&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7265f333d6ca9f72b4cb471b7dd1053cd13a123)

&#x200B;

**Moderate Estimate: FTDs are 1% of Trading Volume**

[ 1&#37; of Trading Volume Fail to Deliver](https://preview.redd.it/wou8bc3qkpl91.png?width=1481&format=png&auto=webp&s=55668268e0859062c99bfd314b3d7cdfad2741fe)

&#x200B;

**High Estimate: FTDs are 3% of Trading Volume**

[ 3&#37; of Trading Volume Fail to Deliver](https://preview.redd.it/eobigrqqkpl91.png?width=1481&format=png&auto=webp&s=a99f99c4496c73a15678e6ac896e95eb8738a9ad)

Even if a meager 0.5% of Trading Volume become FTDs from 11 Aug onwards, we are looking at a pretty sizeable runup. At 1%, the potential run-up looks to be roughly twice the size of the Aug 15 spike. At 3%, the Aug 15 looks like a bad joke.

&#x200B;

The Weekend FUD is perhaps a bit more sinister than it's ever been...,Superstonk,362,x5aoxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x5aoxq/the_weekend_fud_is_perhaps_a_bit_more_sinister/,83,1662255785.0,"I am totally one for objective debate about the weird ass circumstances surrounding this ticker and the general market as a whole. *However...*

A lot of posts today have been calling into question things like, ""***How do we even know that the DTCC committed securities fraud?***"" and ""***Dr. Burry is a Chicken Little, why should we believe there is a market crash coming?***""

These are subtle questions that on the surface appear to be reasonable queries, but the amount of upvotes and rewards these sorts of posts have received, in such a small amount of time, is extraordinarily suspicious to the point where I have to question whether or not these are actually questions made in good faith and not attempts to subconsciously make people question their investments.

The first thread about the DTCC has an innocuous title, but the actual post description uses extremely hostile verbiage and a sarcastic undertone *that implies that there is no evidence to support the idea the DTCC committed fraud*.

The entire comments section of that thread is extremely concerning, because all of the sudden people on this sub are acting as though without something as concrete as a video of Ken Griffin sitting on Palpatine's throne ordering the DTCC to mark the split incorrectly that suddenly this entire investment is a waste of time and that all the DD is worthless without dyed-in-the-wool proof.

Not even to talk about the fact that the financial industry plays things extremely close to the chest whenever their money is on the line, and that even if you follow the paper trails like a lot of hard-working apes have done, investment most of the time is based on ***gut feeling***. I felt that this investment would pay me dividends, and that's what literally happened, and I furthermore think that it's a wonderful long-term hedge against market collapse; as a matter of fact, ***there was such violent disagreement about everything essentially prophesied back in January 2021***, *including the NFT Marketplace and the stock dividend,* ***which we have received by the way***, *and now* ***the entire idea of the MOASS play is being indirectly called into question***.

Something smells extraordinarily fishy, that's all I had to say. Perhaps this is because we're inching closer to October, which is infamous for market crashes, and so perhaps the MOASS is right around the corner, but I'm willing to hold this investment for years if need be."

Uranium Stocks- U.S. government request Billions of dollars for Uranium.,wallstreetbets,353,x55ia8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x55ia8/uranium_stocks_us_government_request_billions_of/,196,1662240969.0,"My recent post about Uranium here was received well, so I thought I would let people know what is about to happen in the small uranium sector.  Very big catalysts. This is why Uranium stocks are up so much the last few weeks. In 2020 When Graphite was added as a critical mineral some of those stocks ran 1000% in a week.

The U.S. has room to believe a Russian Uranium Export or Import ban is coming.The White House emergency funding request for $1.5 Billion dollars for Uranium-""Potential future shortfall in access to Russian Uranium & Fuel Services.""

https://preview.redd.it/atmvc2ntnpl91.png?width=1423&format=png&auto=webp&s=9beda1be1143a6c6bb8ef96805cac6f694c63ca9

$1.5 Billion would get about 30 Million lbs of Uranium today. UXC which is a leading Uranium fuel broker said ""It is unclear whether there is sufficient spot uranium available to accommodate an influx of another $1 billion in purchases."" Note: sput (Sprott Physical Uranium Trust) Removed nearly 40 M lbs U308 last year alone, its first year.

https://preview.redd.it/tcqtdn91opl91.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0b3fe67fd2f00f8dd64aa57d51c0e7c5c384b75

The U.S. government has 2 bipartisan amendment bills to add Uranium to the Critical minerals list. H.R.7938-‚ÄúDomestic Uranium Saves America Act‚Äù & H.R. 8045. As an amendment this could be approved fast,In 2020 Graphite was added-Those stocks ran 1000%+  There are also bills to ban russian uranium imports and billions in other funding for Uranium/Nuclear energy.

https://preview.redd.it/8pxe86j4opl91.png?width=1709&format=png&auto=webp&s=31630a46906a653b38f4422c5091d593db1fdff2

The 2023 U.S. Gov Budget is not yet passed, but the $1.5 Billion for Uranium is added in the Stopgap measure aka the CR which could be passed by congress this month. Deadline 30th Sept.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3fvm601bopl91.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a76e286e15265c43b149b0cb0affc85903378903

If the U.S. DOE started buying up Uranium this fall,typically when U.S. reactors are refueling & there is more spot market vol from  1)Producers 2)Utilities 3)Investors-Large funds -Sput 4)Processors 5)Traders  There could be a big move in Uranium prices. There is already record demand, less supply and next year Honeywell & Urenco will come in and take away most of the secondary uranium supply with their overfeeding. 

https://preview.redd.it/8lxdj9tcopl91.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c65d07d39b19e9ae0c7483444ec8ddd6b686005b

The U.S. Gov has numerous bipartisan bills to Ban Russian Uranium imports,BUT in 2018 Russia sent bills to Duma to Upend Nuclear trade with the U.S. including Enriched Uranium ban after the 2018 U.S. sanctions,Today sanctions western are FAR bigger with more Rosatom employee's & leading government officials sanctioned. Russia could ban the exports of enriched uranium to the west which the west is in total reliance on.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kcgder7jopl91.jpg?width=1237&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a62ff97e8e2d9edce6f753863ad1c22af43ff28

Rosatom was sanctioned by Ukraine after the IAEA just visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.

Uranium prices typically run up in the Spring fall refueling cycle,as pictured below. Spot Uranium last year Sept 2nd was  $37.50,Today $51.25. Even without a government bans or buying there is likely to be another big run in Uranium. $70 min is needed.

https://preview.redd.it/vcb5evopopl91.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cce4eb1fe423f93cbe206160f3fec7b3f12f6e3a

Sprott Physical Uranium Trust broke the record for the most spot uranium volume since 1996 for 14.5 million lbs in Sept 2021. They now have 58.2 Million lbs of physical Uranium,more than the entire U.S. 1 year reactor demand.600k lbs more yesterday added.

https://preview.redd.it/twgygvqropl91.png?width=1255&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b65b01583226f6a599a37e20a2d1fa336895117

Uranium long term contracting is about to see 700 Million lbs. demand coming back as per Kazatomprom.This comes at a time where record restarts,Nuclear energy renaissance across the world & reactor extensions.Long term & spot volumes could see 2006 levels.

https://preview.redd.it/it29ometopl91.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a05cd61bb9d808a24e4d410710dfa3306a5bff37

The world is turning back to nuclear as the energy crisis continues. This is why I think Uranium is one of the best investments in the market. The Uranium sector combined is less than $40 Billion. Smaller than a typical NASDAQ stock.

We don't know anything about the world, she knows everything about it, so she tells us what we don't know any time we get somewhere new.

Then we hit Inazuma, and Paimon didn't know squat.

Somewhat understandable, since Inazuma had recently become aggressively isolationist, information about it's current goings on would be hard to find.

Then we get to Sumaru, and Paimon still doesn't know anything about anything.

Now don't get me wrong. I love Paimon.

But it's annoying that she was introduced as having a clear purpose for traveling with us, and yet apparently she's useless at it."

The fact the DTCC had to resort to such blatant international securities fraud is bullish AF,Superstonk,362,x57k3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x57k3m/the_fact_the_dtcc_had_to_resort_to_such_blatant/,13,1662246594.0,"I feel this needs to be said because people are feeling angry about the what and aren't focussing on the why. The DTCC had to blatantly lie to brokers saying Gamestop wanted the split done as a forward split because to do what Gamestop wanted would have been impossible.

All through this saga we've just wanted to know how many naked shorts exist for GME but it's been impossible to get any clarity on this due to how opaque the stock market actually is. The true SI% is worthless due to this being self-reported and the true pile of naked shorts are all in swaps which don't have to be reported.

**/u/NebulaPlague** created this [**üóíÔ∏è BROKER MASTER LIST of Splividend Confirmations**](https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wjjpwb/broker_master_list_of_splividend_confirmations/) which shows that **AT LEAST** 23 brokers have mishandled the splividend. 23 fucking brokers. At least. Do you think the DTCC would blatantly lie to that many brokers and the thousands (possibly millions) of retail investors they represent if they had any other choice? It was lie like that or go ""whoops no more splivvy shares to go around due to abusive naked shorting, sorry to those who missed out""

My girlfriend doesn't follow any GME stuff and I explained the splivvy mess to her tonight and she asked ""if the DTCC is willing to lie like that, won't they just keep lying and committing fraud to prevent the MOASS?"". And fair point, no one here can guarantee what's going to happen. 

But **WHY** they lied is the most important thing here. They had to lie. If there were no naked shorts they wouldn't have had to lie to 23 brokers, it's as simple as that. They lied about something that is [**publicly available on Gamestop's website**](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-four-one-stock-split), I feel a literal ape could have fact checked this and proven it to be a lie. So this wasn't incompetence, it's malicious and was done deliberately.

So this proves our DD, GME is naked shorted by at least 23 full brokers worth of shares. How many shares is that exactly? Who knows but it's probably a lot. To get out of this mess Ken & pals have to buy back at least 23 brokerage firms worth of GME. Ouch.

I've just watched the Big Short again for the umpteenth time and my tits are jacked because all the warning signs of a crash are here again; record debt levels, mortgage delinquencies rising, bond market collapsing, stock market 18% down YTD, soaring inflation and GME FUD is as prevalent as ever. I'm not saying the current market downturn is due to GME, but all short positions need collateral to keep them open and that collateral is currently burning away. ‚òéÔ∏è whose that calling? Marge? You're calling for Ken? One moment please.

**TLDR:** If anyone asks you how many naked shorts exist for Gamestop, you can now say at least 23 brokers worth.

I made a drone towable radar decoy that school children could make thousands of. Could be useful against Russian air defense.,ukraine,880,x4whub,https://v.redd.it/dx4l5d50snl91,112,1662217334.0,"Decoys are used to protect aircraft from SA and AA missiles that use RADAR.  Drones can tow decoys that anyone can make with supplies they already have.  US/NATO doctrine uses large amounts of decoys for SEAD/HIV strike packages.  By depleting Ru anti-air capability, more Ru fighters can be shot down and more UAF CAS missions can take place.  Given that drones hover a lot, attaching an octahedral reflector to helium balloons without the bottle might distract SA operators if their systems don't ignore things below a certain speed?

Note to mods: If I use the wrong flair, please let me change it instead of removing as this can help save lives."

"No, GME is not acquiring BBBY. And I believe that's a good thing.",Superstonk,1935,x4tbnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x4tbnp/no_gme_is_not_acquiring_bbby_and_i_believe_thats/,136,1662208325.0,"I've seen a LOT of speculation on multiple subreddits about RC's current involvement in BBBY.  Some of the most common (and I believe, misguided) is the speculation that he intends to use GME to acquire BBBY.  I believe that this narrative is copium for BBBY holders (of which I am one), and low-key FUD for GME holders.  

&#x200B;

Here's my Saturday morning opinion dump for anyone who cares to read it.

&#x200B;

**RC and BBBY**

While RC's main focus is his working as Chairman of the Board with GME, he is also a venture capitalist with a ton of good business sense and a massive pile of capital.  I truly believe that BBBY was a side quest for him.  He saw a profitable company (BABY) wrapped up inside a dying company (BBBY) run by corrupt executives who were bilking the shareholders for cash while letting their investment burn to the ground.  

&#x200B;

I truly believe that RC has a love for good businesses, and good business practices.  These values were instilled in him by his father.  He saw an opportunity to rescue a decent business with a lot of potential, so he used some of his capital and connections to do a good thing.  His letter to the board suggested spinning BABY off or selling it. He may or may not have been involved with the entity that would have purchased it.  I admit that when the news came out that he had sold his position in BBBY, I bought the narrative that it was because he was involved in whatever entity would be purchasing BABY, and he had to sell his stake in order to avoid a conflict of interest.  

&#x200B;

However, when BBBY released their [August 18th 8k](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/node/16356/html) there was some wording that made me wonder if RC was still truly involved.

&#x200B;

From the 8K:

*""We* ***were*** *pleased to have reached a constructive agreement with RC Ventures in March* *and* ***are*** *committed to maximizing value for all shareholders. We are continuing to execute on our priorities to enhance liquidity, make strategic changes and improve operations to win back customers, and drive cost efficiencies; all to restore our company to its heritage as the best destination for the home, for all stakeholders.""*

&#x200B;

Something about the use of the past tense ""We **were** pleased to have reached a constructive agreement with RC Ventures in March"" stood out to me.  This reads as if they had reached some kind of agreement in March (no specifics about what was actually agreed upon), but nothing about any agreement moving forward.

&#x200B;

I tried to shrug it off, but it did eat at me for a while.  However, I decided to wait and see what they would reveal in their August 31 statement.

&#x200B;

The statement on August 31 made it very clear that BBBY intends to retain the BABY banner.  Meaning, they are not doing what RC suggested in his letter that they do.  Which, I believe was his only reason for taking a position and cleaning up the board to begin with.  

&#x200B;

It is is my non-professional opinion that Ryan Cohen, being a lover of good business and delighting customers, saw an opportunity to make another business great.  Being the business king that he is, he knew that he couldn't do it himself while focusing on GameStop, so he sent some trusted professionals to attempt to implement his plan.  Ultimately, BBBY opted to retain the more profitable arm of their company and try to turn the whole thing around.  RC's plan was ultimately not embraced, so he exited his position and moved on.  

&#x200B;

**GME and BBBY**

I have seen a LOT of speculation about GME acquiring BBBY.  Most of that speculation has to do with people daydreaming about RC coming for Jeff Bezos by beating him at his own game.  While I think that's not necessarily out of the realm of possibilities, I honestly don't believe that they would start diversifying in to other niche businesses this early on.

&#x200B;

RC and the entire board at GME have been hard at work and hyper focused on turning the once-dying brick and mortar company in to a massive tech giant.  I truly believe that once their intended transformation is complete, they will revolutionize the digital space in ways that most people today cannot comprehend.  The potential for NFT and blockchain technology to touch and benefit almost every space in our economy is enormous.  This is a huge undertaking, and I believe that GME is up to the task.  But it is going to take a lot of time, effort, and money to make this happen. 

&#x200B;

I am old enough to remember when Amazon was just books.  Literally just. books.  They sold books and only books for YEARS, while establishing themselves as a household name.  Eventually, they began to add CD's and such.  The rest is history.  But they started with a singular focus and didn't branch out until they had been successful with just books.

&#x200B;

GME also has a lot of artificially bad PR to contend with.  MSM has been working around the clock for almost two years to make not just the stock, but the entire company look like a joke.  Despite fantastic fundamentals, MSM still insists on labeling GME a ""meme stock"".  That doesn't affect those of us who are loyal shareholders.  We know that GME is a fantastically undervalued company with amazing growth potential, no matter what label the media slaps on it.  But in order to grow in to the giant tech company they intend to become, they have to win the hearts of more than just the apes.

&#x200B;

They also have to work against the ""NFTs are just overpriced JPEGs"" narrative.  They don't have to work too hard, because their product will prove itself once it is implemented to scale.  But currently, social sentiment around GameStop is that it is a junk company with a junk stock.  The average person doesn't understand what is going on behind the scenes, and they believe whatever MSM tells them.  

&#x200B;

I believe that acquiring a completely unrelated company (home goods OR baby products) at this stage of GME's company turnaround would be too costly, too far-fetched from the current business model they are building(at this stage of the game), and generate even more negative sentiment from the media if they attach themselves to another actual ""meme stock"".

&#x200B;

GME doesn't need BBBY.  GME doesn't need BABY.  If they were truly trying to build an empire to rival Amazon, would they not also need to go back and get Chewy back from Petsmart?  

&#x200B;

No.  I believe that RC's primary focus is turning GME in to a tech giant.  He doesn't need to come for Amazon, because GME will eclipse Amazon one day without buying up other stores.

&#x200B;

RC just saw an opportunity to make a business better, and he decided to use his smarts and his cash to take a stab at it.  It just didn't work out.

&#x200B;

I still believe that BBBY has decent squeeze potential.  I still hold a position for now.  But I don't believe that RC is involved anymore.

&#x200B;

Enjoy your weekend, everyone.  And always, BUY, HOLD, DRS."
