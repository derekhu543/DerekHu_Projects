The lawsuit claims Arnal and activist investor Ryan Cohen collaborated in a ""pump and dump"" scheme to artificially inflate the company's stock.

The Bed Bath & Beyond Chief Financial Officer Gustavo Arnal, who was found dead on Friday after falling from the 18th floor of a New York City apartment building, recently was named in a lawsuit accusing him of fraud.

The incident occurred less than two weeks after the executive, 52, was named in a federal class-action lawsuit on allegations of federal securities fraud, insider trading, and breach of fiduciary duty, according to court documents.

His death also comes just days after Bed Bath & Beyond announced it is shuttering 150 stores and slashing 20% of its corporate staff.

Arnal is cited in the suit along with activist investor and GameStop chairman Ryan Cohen, who the lawsuit claims collaborated with the CFO in a ""fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate the price of Bed Bath & Beyond's publicly traded stock.""

The suit, filed in United States District Court for the District of Columbia on August 23, claims that Cohen and Arnal provided ""materially false statements regarding the financial condition and holding situation"" of Bed Bath & Beyond for their financial benefit. The lead plaintiff is investor **Pengcheng Si**.

""The defendants, knowing that the information they disclosed was false, took advantage of the inflated stock price and used fraudulent and misleading SEC filings to sell all their [Bed Bath & Beyond] shares and options at artificially inflated prices to unsuspecting and innocent public investors and then retained control of the profits,"" the suit states. 

On August 18, both Arnal and Cohen sold shares of the company, with Arnal selling more than 42,000 shares for an estimated $1 million, and Cohen selling the entirety of his 9.8% stake through his firm, RC Ventures, causing shares to plummet.

The lawsuit claims Cohen ‚Äî who is also the co-founder of Chewy and chairman of GameStop ‚Äî approached the CFO about his ""pump and dump"" scheme in March 2022, and ""convinced Gustavo that their plan would be a mutually beneficial one.""

""Under this arrangement, defendants would profit handsomely from the rise in price and could coordinate their selling of shares to optimize their returns,"" the lawsuit states. 

Arnal allegedly worked with JPMorgan, which is listed as a defendant in the suit on claims the bank ""aided and abetted"" the plan by ""enabling Cohen to use JPM's accounts to effectuate such transactions and otherwise launder the proceeds of their criminal conduct.""

The lawsuit further notes Cohen's involvement in similar plans, such as elevating GameStop to ""meme stock"" status.

""Cohen has historically employed pump and dump schemes to raise much needed capital and has ignited several meme stocks to jaw-dropping heights,"" the lawsuit states. 

Spokespeople for Bed Bath & Beyond and RC Ventures did not immediately respond to Insider's request to comment."

Law Firm delivered cease and desist notices to four North Texas school districts on Friday morning.,atheism,16471,x5meqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/x5meqp/parents_demand_fort_worth_area_districts_remove/,545,1662296374.0,"https://nordot.app/938969800603320320?c=592622757532812385

The Austin-based Kaplan Law Firm delivered cease and desist notices to four North Texas school districts on Friday morning requesting that they remove all non-compliant ‚ÄúIn God We Trust‚Äù signs from their schools.

The firm represents a group of concerned parents from the Carroll, Mansfield, Keller and Grapevine-Colleyville school districts, who allege that a Texas law requiring schools to display ‚ÄúIn God We Trust‚Äù signs that are donated pushes Christian theology and is a violation of their students‚Äô First Amendment rights.

‚ÄúOur public schools must be places that affirm all students regardless of race or ethnicity, religion, gender identity or sexual orientation,‚Äù the parents said in a joint statement. ‚ÄúOur schools cannot be places that prioritize a singular religious ideology nor can they become political battlegrounds.‚Äù"
TIFU - Posting on Reddit about our sex life with CBAT and now our relationship has ended,tifu,31877,x5nhi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/x5nhi9/tifu_posting_on_reddit_about_our_sex_life_with/,2082,1662299496.0,"Ok this exploded more than I expected, and has been a bit overwhelming with the messages but thought I‚Äôd give an update. 

The attention hasn‚Äôt been exactly positive and this hasn‚Äôt been the best thing to happen for my relationship and it‚Äôs now sadly ended. 

I didn‚Äôt expect it to blow up so much, I should of used an anonymous name instead of my real name and our real ages. 

There aren‚Äôt many 25 year old Tyler Life‚Äôs who are in a relationship with their s/o for 2 years who is 20.

Unfortunately her younger sister recognised this and showed her parents who wasn‚Äôt happy at all and made the situation extremely awkward. 

What made it more awkward, and cemented the fact that it was me, is that they recognised the song. Once at a family dinner we were discussing music tastes and my ex girlfriend stated that I have an odd taste in music. Everyone laughed and pressed me to play something from my phone of what I like as music, to which I then blessed their ears with CBAT.

Her father laughed and said it was terrible, I guess we all have different tastes. Although I nodded in agreement at the time, I was thinking in my head that this is a great fucking song. 

We are over now and I am moving on. I already revealed my face on tiktok, but with the amount of hate I originally got I decided to say I didn‚Äôt have it and backtracked.

I don‚Äôt think the song is that bad and I had no idea she didn‚Äôt like it until recently and as soon as I did I stopped. I didn‚Äôt force her CBAT, not all can handle CBAT, I know it‚Äôs different. 

I know a lot have asked for face reveal and playlist. My playlist I actually burned onto a CD and have been using my CD player. But I‚Äôll go on YouTube and try link all the songs in one playlist and share. 

TL;DR Made Reddit post and finished our relationship"

Your DPP character probably captured and became friends with Dialga or Palkia and or Giratina, and now they're meeting them again. Would they even recognize the player as their friend and trainer from the future? I mean maybe Dialga would, since it's the being of time, but I'm not sure about the others. There's an inherent sadness to the idea that the player recognizes their beloved Giratina but they have to fight against it because it's been ordered to kill them by Volo. Maybe Giratina doesn't know them yet, or maybe it DOES but it's willing to betray them to fulfill its own goal at getting back at Arceus.

Also speaking of Volo. The whole deal with him being the twist villain is extra cool through the eyes of a DPP protagonist. They knew Cynthia, she helped guide them at several points in their original journey, and now here's her supposed ancestor doing the exact same thing. It just adds even more weight to his betrayal. I also like to believe that Togepi eggs are passed on from generation to generation in Cynthia's family, meaning the Togepi in the egg she gives the player in Platinum is a descendant of Volo's Togekiss. Just imagine Dawn/Lucas seeing Volo's Togepi, realising what that might mean, and getting upset because they've been separated from their own Togekiss.

Then there's the fact that the player is separated from their mom, Barry, Lucas/Dawn, Professor Rowan, Cynthia, all of their pokemon and all the other friends and allies they made along the way through DPP.  And now they're constantly being reminded of these people through seeing their ancestors. That and imagine how all of those characters feel having lost THEM. If the player was still the champion when they they were thrown back in time then the whole of Sinnoh just lost its champion under mysterious circumstances. So cool.

Maybe Dawn/Lucas make their way to Lake Verity in PLA and try and find the spot where they received their first pokemon. Or they try and figure out where Twinleaf town will inevitably be built. Maybe they're the one who founded Twinleaf town  (just a fun idea btw, I'm not saying there's anything at all to suggest it's a fact.)

I'm not a fan of the theory that you're your own ancestor because that has some kind of disturbing implications (just thinking of that one Futurama episode). However, I like to believe that whoever the player chooses is Dawn or Lucas, and that they're essentially meeting their ancestor in Rei or Akari and another ancestor in whoever Rei or Akari eventually decides to have kids with. So say you play as Dawn, that means Rei is your ancestor.

After playing PLA I started another playthrough of Platinum with the idea in mind that I was playing as the same character. Just the idea that I'm forming bonds with these pokemon and yet my character is going to be ripped away from them indefinitely at some point after I finish the game...  It's so good. Even if the whole idea is disproven for whatever reason I'm still gonna believe it because it's just so much fun."

It was laid out over five floors, with the men increasing in positive attributes as you ascended.

The only rule was, once you opened the door to any floor, you HAD to choose a man from that floor; if you went up a floor, you couldn't go back down except to leave the place, never to return.

A couple of girlfriends went to the shopping center to find some husbands...

First floor  
The door had a sign saying, ""These men have jobs and love kids.""  
The women read the sign and said, ""Well, that's better than not having a job or not loving kids, but I wonder what's further up?""  
So up they went.

Second floor  
The sign read, ""These men have high paying jobs, love kids, and are extremely good looking.""  
""Hmmm,"" said the ladies, ""But I wonder what's further up?""

Third floor  
This sign read, ""These men have high paying jobs, are extremely good looking, love kids and help with the housework.""  
""Wow,"" said the women, ""Very tempting.""  
But there was another floor so further up they went.

Fourth floor  
This door had a sign saying ""These men have high paying jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, help with the housework and have a strong romantic streak.""  
""Oh, mercy me,"" they cried, ""Just think what must be awaiting us further on!""

So up to the fifth floor they went.

Fifth floor  
The sign on that door said, ""This floor is empty and exists only to prove that women are fucking impossible to please."

The Spark of Magnitude fragment, which increases grenade duration, was literally pulled from this Striker tree. Touch of Thunder is the Arc 3.0 manifestation of that tree. Remember the striker double pulse meta from Y1? Even in D1 we had a perk that increased grenade duration, and Armamentarium was a popular pick for double pulse or lightning grenades. Striker is about turning yourself into a weapon and causing catastrophic arc damage. See: our supers.

**Why did you get enhanced Storm grenades and Warlocks didn't?**

Because storm grenades fit the identity of Titans a lot more than flux or skip grenades. We are all about ""bringing the thunder."" Literally. [We have lore about entering the battlefield in storms.](https://bray.tech/inspect/item/1703598057/lore) Bungie wanted to buff a 4th grenade, like they do with all the grenade aspects (except Stasis of course) and Storm was the perfect fit. **Mind you, Warlocks already have two aspects that buff grenades like Touch of Thunder does.** Hunters had one for stasis, so if any class was going to get one it was going to be us. I've also seen suggestions that Warlocks could have at least gotten the enhanced Storm grenades and nothing else. That was never going to happen, because if they buff one grenade, you would only use that grenade, and it's just an awkward design choice in general - you would want more than just that. **I'm not saying enhanced storm grenades don't fit Warlocks, I'm saying they definitely fit us.**

Please stop posting about this and do any ounce of research into Strikers, I'm begging you. Yes, Warlocks got the short end of the stick with Arc 3.0. Touch of Thunder is not part of that.

No dog should cost $2,000-$5,000 dollars. That's literally just extortion. Dogs literally breed for free; that's what nature does. We shouldn't have to pay $5,000 for a dog. And that's JUST for the dog. That's not including all the future vet visits, the food, the toys, all the accessories etc. I don't have an issue with getting any of that for my dog but a dog shouldn't cost multiple thousands of dollars. There's nothing that can justify that but greedy capitalism. Yeah these people need to make money for what they put into the dog but a lot of these people are making 10x the profit. I don't think we should be extorting something that nature does.. naturally. We force dogs to breed and then we sell their babies. In a way that's fucked up/savage/barbaric if you think about it but that's a conversation for another time. Imagine if another creature did that to humans... we wouldn't hear the end of it from people. 

So no I don't support this capitalist market where dogs coat thousands and thousands of dollars, and that's just to buy them. That's not including the shots, check ups, etc either. Yeah some breeders take care of that for you but that isn't the point. I don't like dog breeders anyway, it's nothing but a capitalist game."

It has since been archived and what is crazy was that the snapshot on that day showed that there was still 750 Bitcoin to give away.  5 Bitcoin is basically 100,000 USD in todays price and at its all time high this would had equate to 325,000 just for visiting a website. More than likely you could had just visited once everyday or even more

From wikipedia source: Gavin Andresen is a bitcoin pioneer and was one of the few developers that actually developed alongside with Satoshi Nakamoto who declared him as the lead developer for the client bitcoin software.  Been quoted,  ""Bitcoin is designed to bring us back to a decentralized currency of the people,"" and ""this is like better gold than gold.""  He also conceived of the Bitcoin Foundation but sadly he stopped contributing in 2016 and criticize bitcoin developers for not increasing network capacity and later got involved in bitcoin cash instead. 

Anyways thought I shared a bit of fun history to lighten up the mood a bit.

But I didn't retire!,MaliciousCompliance,7284,x5maq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/x5maq1/but_i_didnt_retire/,240,1662296028.0,"The following is a post I made on r/ProRevenge. Several commenters said I should post it here as well. I suppose it's actually a reverse case of malicious compliance since it's a troublesome employee who gets their well-deserved comeuppance when her boss decides to go strictly by the book. So here it is copied and pasted below:

My friend (I'll call her Sandy) worked at a travel agency in British Columbia, Canada. It was a small, owner-operated business with the owner and three employees including my friend. Everyone worked Monday to Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

One of my friend's coworkers (I'll call her Jane), an older woman in her early to mid-sixties, was a long-time nuisance employee. Among other sketchy behaviour, Jane was always scamming ways to take time off over and above her official paid vacation time. In order to make up for the lost hours, she would claim overtime hours/pay by supposedly going in to the office in her off hours ""to finish up"" work without being requested by the owner to do so.

Despite being caught in her own lies on a number of occasions and being warned about trying to claim for unsanctioned overtime, the owner of the travel agency was reluctant to officially reprimand Jane or get rid of her. The reason being is the owner discovered after she had hired Jane that Jane had actually been fired from her previous job at another local travel agency for pulling the same stunts; however, Jane had sued her former employer for unfair dismissal and had won a settlement.

After a few years of my friend Sandy working at the travel agency, the owner was ready to retire and offered to sell the business to my friend. Sandy took her up on the deal and took over the business while keeping on Jane and the other employee. Once again, just as the previous owner was afraid to get rid of Jane, so was Sandy for fear of being sued.

When Sandy took over the business, she instituted guidelines regarding taking time off and she established an official ""no overtime"" policy. Jane would still try with her shenanigans but was far less successful in getting what she wanted with my friend in charge. However, Jane still had one trick up her sleeve when she wanted to take time off on a whim. Sandy was a divorced single mom of two boys who were heavily involved in youth hockey. She would sometimes leave the office an hour or two before closing to get her boys to hockey practice or a game. In order to avoid requesting in person and potentially being denied, Jane would wait for Sandy to be out of the office to book a day off if she didn't feel like coming into work or had made plans. Sandy would then arrive at work the next morning only to discover that Jane wasn't coming in.

Despite this happening a number of times, Sandy would usually let it slide since there was now a definite ""no overtime"" policy. Therefore, Jane could no longer claim to come in to work on the weekend or after hours in order to try and make up for the day off. She would either miss out on a day's pay, in turn saving Sandy money as the owner, or it would come out of her remaining paid vacation days. Moreover, two people in the office at one time could usually handle everything. Jane not coming in was really a no-loss situation for Sandy.

There was one time, however, when Sandy was going to be away for one or two work days just before the weekend to take her boys to a hockey tournament. She told both Jane and the other employee both verbally and in writing that they could not book time off for the dates in question since she would be away and needed both of them in the office. Within a few days of giving this notice, Sandy went in to the office on a Saturday to do some paperwork and go through the sales for the week. This is when she discovered that, only the day before, Jane had booked a trip for her daughter and son-in-law to Las Vegas as well as a plane ticket in her name to Calgary where her daughter lived. Both the trip to Vegas and the ticket to Calgary coincided with the dates Sandy would be out of the office. Sandy then checked the vacation booking schedule to further discover that Jane had indeed booked the days off that she had expressly been told she couldn't have.

Not mentioning she had discovered the travel Jane had booked for herself and her daughter, Sandy emailed Jane telling her she would have to deny her the days off since she had already been told they were unavailable because she (Sandy) would be away and needed Jane in the office. Through a continued series of email exchanges, Jane replied and outright lied to Sandy with some excuse about her daughter getting some long-awaited medical treatment or surgery, and she needed to go to Calgary to help out for a few days and look after her granddaughter. Sandy replied to this lie by telling Jane she knew about the trip she had booked to Vegas for her daughter and son-in-law; that Jane's trip to Calgary was most likely to babysit her granddaughter while her daughter was in Vegas; and that she would still have to deny Jane the days off especially since she booked them after being told they were unavailable.

Jane countered in her subsequent reply, without even addressing the fact that she had been caught in a lie, that she had been a dedicated employee of the travel agency for several years and couldn't understand why she was being treated so unfairly after all she had done for the business. She then wrote that since she wasn't being treated as a valued employee, she had no choice but to retire and was giving her two-weeks' notice. Despite Jane's threat, Sandy replied that she would still be unable to grant her the days off and left it at that without making any mention of Jane's threat to quit/retire.

Sandy then contacted her accountant, who also acted as her de facto business advisor, and explained what had happened with Jane. Also aware of Jane's previous shenanigans, Sandy's accountant told her that this was the out she had been looking for with Jane, and she had it all in writing. He told her that Jane had essentially resigned/retired and all Sandy needed to do was honour Jane's desire to do so, let her finish out her two weeks, or pay her two-weeks' wages in lieu with no further severance pay legally required since she hadn't been fired.

The following Monday, Sandy went into the office early accompanied by her longterm boyfriend to act as a witness. She put Jane's belongings from her desk into a box and took the things that were property of the business. Since Jane was old school and had resisted inputting client information in the computer database, this also included a small box filled with index cards which had client phone numbers, addresses, credit card information, and other personal information noted on them. In the meantime the other employee had arrived for work, and they all waited for Jane to show up.

Jane arrived just before 9:00 acting as though nothing had happened and greeted everyone with a ""good morning"" as she walked through the door. However, she was apparently taken slightly aback when she noticed Sandy's boyfriend seated in the far corner of the office. At this point, Jane was mid-way to her desk when Sandy informed her that there was no need to go any further and that she had accepted Jane's notification of retirement. She then handed Jane a cheque compensating her for the hours she had worked in the current pay period as well as two-weeks' wages in lieu of Jane finishing out her final two weeks before her ""retirement"".

Jane was dumbfounded and went into panic mode, ""But I didn't retire! I'm not ready to retire!""

Sandy responded that indeed she had retired, given her notice and had proof of it in writing. All Jane could do was continue repeating, ""But I didn't retire! I'm not ready to retire!"" while unsuccessfully attempting to get the support of the other employee who refused to come to her defence. Sandy then pointed to the box containing Jane's belongings, wished her a happy retirement, and told her to leave the office. Jane quickly rifled through the box and noticed that the small box containing the index cards with client informaiton was not there. She insisted that Sandy return it to her which Sandy refused to do explaining that it was property of the business, contained personal client information, and that she would be in violation of Canadian privacy laws if she were to let Jane take it. Jane's shock had now turned to obstinance and she refused to leave without the box. Both the other employee and Sandy's boyfriend had started to get involved, repeatedly telling Jane to just leave.

Sandy then informed Jane that if she didn't leave, they would have to call the RCMP (Canadian police), at which point, Sandy's boyfriend dialled 911 to inform the dispatcher of a disgruntled former employee at XYZ Travel Agency who was refusing to leave the premises. Within a few minutes, two police officers arrived, and Jane immediately ran to the door ranting about being fired and about the missing box of client info. In order to deescalate the situation, one police officer told Jane to come outside and explain to him her side of the story. The other officer remained in the office to hear Sandy's side of the story agreeing that Jane was not legally entitled to the box of client info. The other officer then reentered the business and told Jane to wait outside. He said that Jane was insisting that Sandy was holding onto her personal belongings, namely a box of important information. Both Sandy and the officer who had spoken to her explained the contents of the box to the other officer who in turn agreed it was not Jane's property. The police officers then picked up the larger box of Jane's personal belongings, took it outside to Jane, and told her she needed to go home.

To rub salt in Jane's wounds, the next day, Sandy put up a large sign in the window of the business congratulating Jane on her retirement and even put a small announcement in the local newspaper doing the same thing. The icing on the piece of revenge cake was Sandy, when filling out the necessary government forms for when an employee quits / gets fired / retires, made sure to check the box labelled ""retired"" for the reason for Jane no longer being employed. By doing so, Jane was ineligible to collect unemployment insurance benefits."

During the pandemic lockdowns, I started getting headaches which my doctor said was stress. I eventually collapsed and ended up in hospital where they diagnosed me with Glioblastoma.

I'm in my local hospice and I see other patients with family and friends. I have no family and no real friends who have stuck around. I am on my own and I am so scared to pass with no-one by me.

As a Droid, L3 was constantly pushing back on Lando, speaking her mind, and in one climactic scene she engineers a Droid revolution AND a slave breakout at the same time. 

Sadly, while leaving the planet, L3 is shot and destroyed. Lando is able to extract her memory module, and she is uploaded to the ship, where she can use her problem solving cleverness to help make the Falcon the best ship in the galaxy. 

Is this not truly horrifying? She's now a silent slave for literally eternity (or until the Falcon is destroyed). She has no output for her revolutionary ideas. She literally just make ship go zoom."

Gustavo Arnal, 52, joined Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY.O) in 2020. He previously worked as CFO for cosmetics brand Avon in London and had a 20-year stint with Procter & Gamble (PG.N), according to his LinkedIn profile. On Friday at 12:30 p.m. ET (1630 GMT), police responded to a 911 call and found a 52-year-old man dead near the building who appeared to suffer injuries from a fall. Police identified the man as Gustavo Arnal. The police statement did not provide further details on the circumstances leading to Arnal's death but added that the New York City Medical Examiner's Office will now determine the cause of the fatality.

On Aug. 16, Arnal, sold 55,013 shares in the company, Reuters' calculations showed based on SEC filings. The big-box chain - once considered a so-called ""category killer"" in home and bath goods - has seen its fortunes falter after an attempt to sell more of its own brand, or private-label goods. Last week, Bed Bath & Beyond said it would close 150 stores, cut jobs and overhaul its merchandising strategy in an attempt to turn around its money-losing business.

Is he even a Dachshund?,Dachshund,825,x60cqs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/x60cqs,151,1662332443.0,"We've taken him into our back yard where he now has a dog house for shelter and water. We feed him small amounts of decent kibble throughout the day as he was throwing everything up the first day. The vomiting has stopped and his appetite has returned powerfully. We have a vet appointment set up, but it isn't until Saturday, but we're calling first thing every morning to try to bump the date up a bit.

He has multiple problems. The worst for him is the out of control claws. Two or three have curled all the way around and are growing back into his paws. He barely uses his right front leg anymore. He's clearly in severe pain. The next problem is the obvious, which is the possible mange all over him. He also has fleas, an eye infection in both eyes, 

I'm not sure why I'm posting this. Does anyone have a guess for his age? Any tips on keeping him comfortable until the vet visit? Any comments or musings in general?"

He wanted me to get down to 100 lbs. I now know, because of so many people warning me on reddit that I am already technically underweight at 121 lbs. At first I thought he was just looking out for my health, because I genuinely believed him that I weighed too much. I have had low self esteem and self image issues my whole life so that's why I believed him. After making a couple posts on here, many people started flooding to my comments telling me not to lose weight, and that my boyfriend was manipulating me. I was angry that they would say that at first. I defended my boyfriend and fed into his lies that bmi wasn't accurate for women, due to lower muscle mass. Today I brought it up with him again, and after having a bit of a fight he admitted to me that he knows it would be unhealthy for me to lose weight, but he just has a thing for skinnier women and he likes to be double a woman's weight.  He says that a couple days ago he was faking not being able to hold me for more than a few seconds to make me feel heavy (he is over 200 lbs). He also told me since I'm quite tall he's no longer attracted to me anymore since I gained a few pounds from when we first met, because he likes smaller women. I was very upset at him for lying to me and manipulating me, and he ended up grabbing me and pushing me against the wall to shake me when I said I wanted to go to leave and go back to my mum's house. I didn't believe he would ever do something like that and now it has made me realise that I was always following along with what he wanted our whole relationship, even when I didn't want it. He would sometimes pressure me to do things I wasn't comfortable with and I never thought it wasn't normal. I managed to get out of the house and I'm at my parents house now, but I just wanted to say thank you to everyone here that warned me about this"

I already posted in legal advice and things are just looking bleak for me. I made an OF account a bit ago to help my dad with some bills, and I figured maybe I could get a small amount of extra income. But it turned out I started getting WAY more than I thought and eventually my mother found out. She sent very explicit pictures of me to my dad, my little brother and all his friends, all my dad friends, her friends, professors and the dead at my college, and even posts pictures of me on her FB and Instagram. It is incredibly humiliating and honestly I am pretty comfortable with my body but I never wanted my dad and my brother to see like that. I just dont know what to do anymore  


EDIT: To the people asking for my OF. Look normally I would love to show you! But I am not trying to use this as any advertisement and I am not even sure I will keep doing it yet so giving me money right now would just be for pictures. But yeah I advertise on a different account but not this one. I hope you guys understand"

TIFU / My (20F) girlfriend of two years told me the music that I (25M) play during sex is weird and a major turn off,TylerLife,1420,x5uhqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TylerLife/comments/x5uhqz/tifu_my_20f_girlfriend_of_two_years_told_me_the/,174,1662317357.0,"A little back story; when I first started having sex I researched into ways to be better as I was a little stiff and pretty much had no idea what I was doing. I read online that you can play music and match the rhythm in order to put on a better performance.

I searched love making songs and started slowly creating a playlist in which I was comfortable matching the rhythm.

There are a few songs to my playlist. However there is one song in particular, which actually happens to be my favourite, that my girlfriend hates and says turns her off in a major way. 

I don‚Äôt understand why it has taken her two years to tell me she hates that song, it‚Äôs a good love making song with good rhythm. I feel the way I fucked up is I could have possibly asked her previously if she likes the playlist or any songs she‚Äôd like to add/change. But to leave it for two years thinking our sex life is great but in her eyes has just been ruined by my music has left the whole situation feeling awkward and I‚Äôm a bit annoyed. 

I pretty much played this tune every single time so the amount of times she must have not been enjoying it, when I thought the complete opposite is annoying but also embarrassing in ways. 

Not to mention my previous partners, however they never complained about the song so maybe it‚Äôs just her?

It‚Äôs fucked up the relationship tbh because sex feels awkward now. The other day we were having sex with no music but I was still thrusting to the tune playing in my head. She recognised this and asked me to stop.  

I thought this song was perfect and I always thrust along with the tune and feel it gives me the perfect rhythm for doing the deed to. I usually bust to this song and find it devastating she hates the song. 

[the song itself](https://youtu.be/KAwyWkksXuo)

TL;DR She hates my love making tunes and didn‚Äôt tell me for over two years making sex now awkward."

If attendance is compulsory, then plenty of satisfying calories should be provided to get kids through the day. 

""But it'll be too expensive!"" Then this nation really is lost if we can't find a few bucks worth of food to give to kids each day during the school year. Think of another important need that is provided for in many cases: transportation. Schools bus their students without the need for students to pay. Imagine how crazy it'd be if each kid had to pay the school bus fare every time they rode it? Messed up, right? To me, it's the same with food. Just give them a dang meal."

https://reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/x2qsly/tonights_the_night/

TL;DR: a 15 year old decided he was going to take 20-28 grams after tripping twice. He wanted to cure his depression. Many people warned him this was a bad idea.

He disappeared (stopped commenting and posting) so I was worried about him. I was able to get in touch with him on Snapchat. 

The trip did not go well. Here is what I know:

-	He ended up taking 23 grams
-	He had a seizure but survived it
-	His parents found him in a state of severe psychosis. He was blacked out at the time.
-	Since that trip he has lost 13 pounds
-	He now wakes up in the middle of the night with cold sweats so bad his bed is soaked
-	He was grateful I checked in on him but he doesn‚Äôt really want to talk about the trip. He said it was okay to update Reddit.

I feel really bad for him. I did a lot of really dumb stuff when I was 15. 

Anyway, let this be a warning to people. Mushrooms are not harmless and heroic doses should be approached gradually and with caution. Insane doses, like the one he took, should probably not be attempted by most. If you are young, let your brain develop before messing with its chemistry. Be safe, be careful."

[Pop Music] How one bad joke cost a singer the support of an entire country for the rest of his career,HobbyDrama,779,x5x4rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/x5x4rb/pop_music_how_one_bad_joke_cost_a_singer_the/,40,1662324015.0,"**Introduction**  
In the early 2000's, Tiziano Ferro was a rising star in pop music. [An italian singer, with a baritone voice, a handsome appearance and soft pop ballads.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVzqlv-0eFs) He was a magnet for a worlwide audience, but particularly, that of latin-american countries with his spanish / italian lyrics.  
In 2004 and 2005 he was certified with gold and platinum discs for his album ""111 Ciento Once"", by the mexican association AMPROFON. He lived in Mexico for a time, and the audience loved him.... until the incident.  
_  
**Controversy**  
In 2006,[ Ferro went in an interview with the italian show Che Tempo Fai](https://youtu.be/FBvMOpLO3BU). Everything was going well until he tried to be funny and made a joke at the expense of mexican women.  
Quoting him: ""It's not possible to say that mexican women are the most beautiful in the world. With all due respect, they are *mustache-y*.""  
The interviewer tried to interject, saying that it could offend some people, and that apologies were asked for. To which Tiziano decided to continue the joke.  
-Ferro: ""I understand, and I'm sorry, but even they know it!""  
-Interviewer: ""Well, personally I do think they are the most beautiful in the world""  
-Ferro: ""But how many? Salma Hayek, that's the only one I've seen""  
 He probably thought it was an innocent joke. Less than 20 seconds of an interview, which was in italian, so who would care?  
_  
**Fallout**  
Around that time, Ferro was touring to promote his new album * Nessuno √® solo (Nadie Est√° Solo)*,  ""Nobody is Alone"". But according to the response of the mexican audience, it seems he was the one alone. When he arrived in Mexico City for his tour, he was received by a group of different media outlets and...not much else. Some people thought fans would arrive with fake moustaches, as a way to lighten up the situation or show defiance, but he was met with complete indifference of most of his former fans.  
But not everyone left him alone, for outside his hotel, members of his official fan club showed up to claim support for him. Ten of them.  
Media asked for declarations from CD stores, which responded that ""the number of albums that had to be given back was confidential"". Radio stations received some angry calls if he was played. He wasn't banned, stations had his new songs, but they just weren't playing him anymore. People stopped asking for his songs during request hours. He dissapeared from the local MTV channel top lists of the year. His 2006 album didn't even enter the 100 Most Sold Albums of the year. [The conductor of the most popular morning talk show wore a fake mustache and ripped a picture of him on live TV](http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/img/2006/05/Esp/elizabeth.jpg) (Remember, this is 2006, TV is still The Thing) Fans basically turned their backs on him.  
To show the extent of the damage that one joke caused: He then released other 5 albums, from 2006 to 2016. None of them have ever sold out in Mexico again nor did they received any certification from AMPROFON since 2005."

The way this creature shows up at latrines and fertilizer piles gives a hint this is tied to Tlazolt√©otl, who is also tied to filth but this god isn't seen as malevolent, it a cleansing god that eats filth.

[Mexicolore also covers dwarfism, making this even more confusing.](https://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/ask-us/how-did-the-aztecs-treat-abnormalities)

Is there a cultural, philosophical, or religious meaning I am missing in this creature? Or am I misunderstanding Tlazolteotl?"

As part of my quest to visit every MLB stadium before I die, I came to your fair city to hang out for the weekend.  I've now seen 18 different MLB teams play at their home parks, and I can't lie: from what I've seen so far, you guys deserve your reputation as the best baseball fans in the country.  You sold out the stadium on Saturday, you all showed up before the second inning (it occurs to me that this might not seem impressive to you, but in many stadia, it takes literally two or three innings for everyone to show up), everyone was actually watching the game (this probably also makes no sense to some of you, but in some cities, people just treat the game like background wallpaper, and all but ignore the game while they talk to their friends about work and life), and everyone was friendly and polite -- this is not always the case, to put it mildly.

In the hotel elevator this afternoon, an elderly woman saw my Yankees hat and made small talk with me about Bader.  This really is a baseball town.  Anyway, I just wanted to show my respect, as I didn't get the chance to say this to anyone here."

Issue is that my nephew goes to school with him and alteady had a lot of issues with him because the boy is a psychopath so it would be great if it wouldn't be obvious that we fucked it up. 
Any ideas how to do that?
The kid also locked my nephew into a shed and left him there, tried to poison our turtles and is overall know to be a little shithead, running around with a huge knife and stuff."

The most recent OneDnD brought this starkly into light for me. Ardlings and Tieflings are basically spell sticks with very little actual flavor of celestial or infernal origins in terms of mechanical design. Gnomes and even Elves now just get a minor feature and some spellcasting.

I would personally prefer they tried harder to create unique features, especially since giving a race a spell basically adds it to a Caster class' spell list while not giving a similar benefit to Martials, enforcing the bias yet again."

She missed the male street cat by less than an inch but holy shit it was incredible to see her coming to the defence of the cat.

The dog is standing guard by the cat bed right now and I'm so happy to see her treating the cat like one of the family (even though I hate the cat).

Junior memberships are relatively cheap and his friend decides to join up and play with him. To play faster my son decided to play off the ladies tees.

Surely they should be encouraging fast pace of play for beginners?

TL:DR Course marshall tells two 16 year old beginners they can‚Äôt play off the ladies tees on a very quiet Thursday evening."

As an English major, it's always a nice surprise when I make it past the initial resume screenings for these kinds of companies. 

Two weeks ago, I received an email saying that I had gone through the screening and that I was invited to complete a pre-recorded interview (HireVue).

A week later, I get a second email saying I've made it to a final round interview with the manager who would be directly overseeing me. She sent me her calendar and I scheduled my interview. 

I poured so much time preparing for this interviewing, perfecting my pitch, looking at the website, role responsibilities, etc. 

On the day of the interview, I log into the Zoom meeting but she never shows up. 

I email her as I'm still in the meeting to see what happened, and she replies that she mixed up her time zones. She offers me another interview the same day, but at a time when I have an extremely important meeting that I cannot miss. I tell her that I'm open to meeting the next day/same week and she ends up not responding. 

The next day, I receive an email from HR saying they have decided not to move forward with my application. What upsets me the most is that she never gave me the chance to complete an interview, especially considering it was she who messed up."

Until now. I started adding a tablespoon of butter to my already cooked oatmeal, and stirring it in as it melts. Something about it elevates oatmeal from sticky, to silky. Since I started adding butter, I wake up craving my morning oatmeal, instead of having to convince myself to make it. 

Oatmeal is cheap and healthy. Butter is neither, but the tiniest amount elevates morning oats to a delicacy. If a small amount of butter makes me more likely to eat oats, vs something more expensive and less healthy, it‚Äôs a frugal win."

Second hand but English is my first language so please nitpick my grammar.

My dad works for an employee owned civil construction company, they make water processing plants among other public utility buildings. Contracts can range from 10 to 50 million dollars and more after expenses. They spend the vast majority of said budget on materials. Again Millions of dollars. 

One company they get parts from is their main supplier of pipes and plumbing doohickeys. They spend about a third of their budget with them, again specialty in water treatment plants. He has even received awards for being one of their top 5 customers, 2 years ago it was a fire hydrant cookie jar which he found hilarious. 

This particular job was on the east coast in a state where my dad has yet to work. As such he goes to the office personally to meet these people, on principle mind you. He‚Äôs just that type of guy. He meets the staff, or most of them. What he didn‚Äôt know was that one lady was out that day, her day off. Eventually the budget has been worked out and the structural base has been mostly completed. 

So my dad calls the suppliers to place his order. You know exactly who he gets, the one lady he didn‚Äôt get to meet. So the conversation goes a bit like this;

Dad: Hello, this is Dad, I need to order some parts.

Lady: Of course, do you have an account with us?

Dad: Yes, this construction company.

Lady types a bit: I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt see an account for this construction company.

Dad: Yes, we do. Could you please check again?

Lady: I‚Äôm afraid we don‚Äôt have an account for this construction company.

Now, it is important to note that, A. My dad takes no shit, and he knows she didn‚Äôt recheck because he couldn‚Äôt hear her rather loud keyboard typing and B. To create an account requires a credit history check which can take 5-10 business days to get done. This company, my dad included, runs a tight ship so this is entirely unacceptable.

Dad: look, can I speak with Owner, I met him yesterday and I would like to clear this up quickly.

Lady: I‚Äôm afraid Owner is unavailable right now. I could create an account for you if you‚Äôd like.

Dad: Look, I need to buy 70,000 dollars of prep materials, and I need them by next week. Please try again to find our account. This construction company is one of your top clients and if you ask me to create a new account I will go elsewhere.

Lady, still not trying again says: I apologize for the inconvenience, If you feel that you could get better service elsewhere than you are free to do so.

My dad immediately hung up fuming. He had to take 2 more days and 10,000 more dollars but he got the parts on time. He then came into the office a week later, passed by the front desk and knocked on Owner‚Äôs door. ‚ÄúSir, you can‚Äôt be back here‚Äù 

wouldn‚Äôt you know it was the Lady from before. My dad just waited and when Owner opened the door, he greeted Dad like an old friend. After explaining the situation, the owner immediately called the lady in, calmly berated her and showed her exactly how to find This construction company in the future, (My dad isn‚Äôt someone to get people fired, better to humiliate them into competence). 

The owner then called corporate who authorized a 10% discount on piping as an apology. This contract had a piping budget of  9 million dollars so that discount went straight to profits. As a stockholder that goes to my dad‚Äôs pockets as well. He‚Äôs never had a problem before nor since.

&#x200B;

tl;dr Dad saves a Lot of money."

I charge my phone on my dresser so when my alarm goes off I have to get up to turn it off, I just don‚Äôt have a need for one I guess.

Idk what to call this style I guess. But I love the freshness of the white walls mixed with bright colors. 

We just are moving rooms around so it‚Äôs just this side of the room for now. Still wondering what to do with the other side yet."

After months of fruitless internet searching & calling around, I finally found a salvage shop in Tampa that had what seemed like the parts. Unfortunately the shop doesn‚Äôt sell online or ship and they‚Äôre in Florida while I‚Äôm in Maryland. But as luck would have it, I discovered a friend lives just 10 min from the shop. She picked it up and shipped it to me. 

Cleanup was pretty easy - soak in crock pot to soften paint, remove paint with steel wool, polish with brasso & steel wool. 

Installation was‚Ä¶ fun? It took about 2 hours to figure out how to install it into the window. All the pieces screw into one another but all with a very specific ordering in order to have the space to twist and turn without scratching the wood or shattering the glass. 

And now? Now it‚Äôs done! And I‚Äôm posting it here cause you‚Äôre the only folks who might appreciate it."

religious preacher got arrested in fort calgary today,Calgary,295,x61blx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Calgary/comments/x61blx/religious_preacher_got_arrested_in_fort_calgary/,55,1662335215.0,"so as some of you may know, the pride parade was today. the parade went fine and there was no issues until the festival in fort calgary happened. i was with my brother and a friend and we met up with a couple more people there. out on the sidewalk behind the bouncy house and food trucks there were preachers there with police lined up in the background. 

ofc bc they‚Äôre preachers at a pride event, they were being homophobic. nobody got physical with him until the end of his preaching.

he had a bluetooth speaker and mic which he was using to spew his homophobic bs. someone turned off the speaker and he started getting angry and ended up shoving the girl who turned it off (harmless action she committed, i know) he then got physical with everyone around him and started shoving and throwing punches at CHILDREN. MINORS. people who are fighting for their rights TO THIS DAY IN 2022. 

needless to say; if you don‚Äôt want people ‚Äúsinning‚Äù around you, keep your beliefs down your throat and DO NOT shove them down mine. 

happy pride everyone"

"The anti gunner started it, so I'm gonna fucking call them on it: Canada knife attack was 7 times deadlier than the average active shooter incident in the US over the past 2 years.",gunpolitics,279,x61ma2,https://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/x61ma2/the_anti_gunner_started_it_so_im_gonna_fucking/,43,1662336059.0,"So some idiot on a removed r/news post said:

> That's an American-level death toll. And without the use of firearms. My heart goes out to our friends to the north. 

Cute deflection at the end aside, let's actually look at that claim. FBI statistics for active shooters, 2020 and 2021: [https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/active-shooter-incidents-in-the-us-2021-052422.pdf/view](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/active-shooter-incidents-in-the-us-2021-052422.pdf/view)

In those two years, there were 101 active shooter incidents recognized by the FBI. On average, there were 1.3 deaths per incident. As of writing this, 10 people have died in this attack. That's over 7 times the number of deaths from the average active shooter incident in the US.

The only real takeaway from this is to be glad that most muckers don't have a plan going in. Initial reporting suggests that the two suspects targeted people in a remote community one house at a time, preventing the alarm from being raised more quickly."

"They uncovered a mass grave in the Carolinas. Please, lock your doors.",nosleep,1821,x5naak,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x5naak/they_uncovered_a_mass_grave_in_the_carolinas/,75,1662298922.0," First off, I need to state that I‚Äôm a man whose faith is that of science. I believe in germ theory and general relativity. The supernatural is not my ball game. Never has been. I am skeptical of all things people think can‚Äôt be explained with science.  

I grew up with a bible thumping father and no mother, because apparently sepsis is all part of God‚Äôs plan. My mother died at home with a fever of more than 105 Fahrenheit. My dad didn‚Äôt believe in theories. Not medicine or Cro-Magnon man. There was just god and his plan. 

Although I‚Äôd like to think my father had no influence on my life, I suppose all this led me to where I am now. I‚Äôm the head of the anthropology department at a large southern university. My work, my life, it‚Äôs all rock dust and carbon dating. Tables laid with tangible bones far older than 5,000 years with computer data to prove it. 

My father said such things were put in the dirt by the devil. Fossil record was but a test of faith. I hate that man, but now I‚Äôm wondering if somehow, like a broken clock being right twice a day, that the bastard was right.

Anthropologists aren‚Äôt usually the recipients of late-night business calls. So when my work cell rang at 11pm, I figured I‚Äôd either been butt-dialed or it was another spam call about a vehicle warranty.

I answered all the same. ‚ÄúHello, this is Professor Hinckley.‚Äù

‚ÄúProfessor, this is Deputy Nick Caper. I‚Äôm with the Oconee County Sheriff‚Äôs Office. I‚Äôm sorry to bother you at this hour, sir. You were recommended to me by the folks at Clemson.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt specialize in forensic anthropology, but I‚Äôd done work for the state before when human remains of Native peoples were found. I must admit, calls like this made me feel important. I puffed out my chest and tried to shake the sleep out of my voice. ‚ÄúHi yes, how may I help you, young man.‚Äù 

*Young man.* I cringed. I wasn‚Äôt even fifty who was I trying to be?

‚ÄúSir, we‚Äôre trying to stay ahead of the press on this, so your discretion would be greatly appreciated. We got a call this afternoon, someone‚Äôs dog wandered off on a walk in Sumter and came back with a femur in his mouth.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well the owner went lookin‚Äô to see where he fetched it from and found some human remains. They‚Äôre old, so we‚Äôre not talking about murder or at least any kind of active investigation, but the thing is, there‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äòum.‚Äù

‚ÄúA lot of bones?‚Äù

‚ÄúYessir. Dozens. As in dozens of bodies. Problem is it doesn‚Äôt seem to be a burial ground. The dead folks, well they‚Äôre wearing western style clothes. Shirts and trousers and such. We did some research and read that mass graves of bodies all piled on each other like this would be peculiar.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt would,‚Äù I said as I pinched my noise. ‚ÄúI take it you need someone to come out and take a look?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôd be very grateful. You can bring whoever you like. We just need this identified before our little town gets overrun by them media types filling the bars.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, the county isn‚Äôt familiar. Where did you say you were?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt worry that‚Äôs just how we like it here. We‚Äôre in Western South Carolina. Sumter National Forest. I‚Äôll email you all the details.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOk,‚Äù I sighed. ‚ÄúOk, I can get there tomorrow but it‚Äôll be somewhat later. 5pm or so. I‚Äôll bring my team with me.‚Äù

*My team.* I cringed again. It was a fancy term for a couple of broke graduate students. 

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll tell the Sheriff. Thank you, Professor. Apologies again about the hour.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it. Bye now.‚Äù

I hung up and googled Sumter National Forest. That part of the park in Oconee county was isolated. I clicked my thumb nail in my teeth. *Western style clothing.* I figured it could be the mass grave from an old epidemic that hit some settlers. 

Everything about this felt strange. From the phone call to the circumstances. Who at Clemson would recommend me? It was Friday and I hoped my *team*, Meredith and Casey weren‚Äôt going to be too hungover to work as I went back to bed.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_

The three of us carpooled and hit the road around 3pm. It was a later start than I‚Äôd have liked, but we would be at address the deputy sent me around 6pm. 

As it turned out the address that was sent to me was more of a crude way point. The bodies were found nearly 400 feet from a trail and I had thought we were lost until I saw a trailhead parking lot with a few law enforcement vehicles in it.

We got out and stretched our legs. We had several large bags of excavation equipment and hauling them off trail would be a hell of a workout. I was beginning to regret even saying yes to this. Still, the circumstances were intriguing. This grave could be the site of some previously unknown event in early American history. 

I tried to tell myself that I should be excited. *You should quit acting like such an old man.* 

I met with the Sheriff, Deputy Caper and a few county clerks that were simply curious.  

The hike in wasn‚Äôt as strenuous as I thought it‚Äôd be. It was entirely flat, but the bramble we had to wade through had strewn my skin with scrapes. I was actually blinking away a little blood by the time we got there. 

The dig site itself was clear. All the bushes and even small trees had all been sawn away, leaving an open patch of land about the size of a two-car garage. The ground was slightly dug up, a ring of earth lay around the mass grave.  

I immediately noticed something was off. The bones that were visible were blackened, as if they were burnt. Their clothing had curled from flames, and what little of the cotton was left was bunched and dirty. Still, I could tell the clothing was certainly not native. 

I looked at Deputy Caper with my mouth slightly agape. ‚ÄúThese bodies have been burnt.‚Äù

He turned to the Sheriff. ‚ÄúI told you, Sheriff. Ain‚Äôt no way dirt and time does that to skeletons.‚Äù 

The Sheriff huffed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre no archeologist, Nick. So, what do you think this was?‚Äù The Sheriff looked at me expectantly as if I should already know the answers. ‚ÄúSome kind of sickness or massacre?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have no idea.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHow old are they do you think?‚Äù

I glared at him and repeated myself. ‚ÄúI have no idea. Old.‚Äù 

‚ÄúLike the seventeen hundreds?‚Äù

I nodded. 

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs certainly past the statute of limitations. Hell, South Carolina might not have been a state and Oconee county wasn‚Äôt even a twinkle in this country‚Äôs eye. Not much we can do here, is there?‚Äù

I wanted this buffoon gone so I nodded again. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll work until it gets dark and get an early start tomorrow. We‚Äôll update you as soon as we learn anything. In the meantime, I‚Äôd appreciate if you reached out to someone with the South Carolina Historical Society. I can date these bones, but I won‚Äôt be able to tell you what these people were doing here.‚Äù

The Sheriff hiked up his utility belt. ‚ÄúWe actually tried. They didn‚Äôt answer when we called Friday night. We left a message, but we expect we‚Äôll hear back Monday. We also contacted a couple other universities, but no one wanted to come out on the weekend it seems.‚Äù

Meredith and Casey looked at me peeved as they hadn‚Äôt exactly wanted to come either, but I suggested it might help their grade. I stood straight and cleared my throat. I didn‚Äôt think I was a chump for giving up my weekend to investigate a find of this importance. I thought it was southern societies‚Äô fault and not mine for being more interested in barbecues than mass burials. 

‚ÄúWell, they‚Äôre missing out. This is certainly something extraordinary.‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing we need to be concerned about though, right?‚Äù 

The two cops seemed listless. They wanted to be dismissed. I sighed, almost disappointed. ‚ÄúNo, probably not.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOk, well we‚Äôre off then. The wife‚Äôs been looking after the brisket today so,‚Äù the Sheriff crossed his fingers. ‚ÄúFingers crossed!‚Äù 

The deputy unfurled a length of crime scene tape and started wrapping it around trees as they walked back. ‚ÄúSo you can find your way to the trail,‚Äù he nodded at the tape. ‚ÄúIt gets awfully dark out here.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù

The deputy suddenly frowned. ‚ÄúAnd professor, are you staying at the Days inn in Walhalla?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre not staying in Walhalla. We found a little bed in breakfast in Pleasant Falls. Just ten or so minutes from here.‚Äù

The Sheriff laughed and shook his head while the Deputy‚Äôs eyes widened ‚ÄúPleasant Falls? There‚Äôs a B&B there?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I was feeling defensive at this point. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cheap as all hell.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI bet. Just so you know the folks are a bit cooky there.‚Äù

‚ÄúCooky how?‚Äù Blurted out Meredith.

‚ÄúWell, rumor has it everybody in that town‚Äôs got the same great grandparents. If you catch my drift. There‚Äôs all but 23 of them, too. Pleasant Falls ain‚Äôt a town, it‚Äôs a hamlet.‚Äù  

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just sleeping there. It‚Äôs better to stay closer to the work site. Makes early mornings all the easier. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre going to the bar there.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, just thought we‚Äôd give you the heads up. The Day‚Äôs Inn in town always has vacancy so if you do change your mind just drive right over.‚Äù 

I nodded. ‚ÄúThank you, gentlemen.‚Äù 

They disappeared into the woods and we began unpacking some of our equipment. 

In the darkening woods it took us far longer to get set up than I‚Äôd anticipated. 

I realized these were likely the newest bones I‚Äôd ever dealt with professionally. I was used to brown and yellowed skulls. Fragmented remains where I‚Äôd piece the bones of ancient people‚Äôs back together like a puzzle. I was out of my depth here. I was certain then, as interesting as it was, that I shouldn‚Äôt have agreed to come. 

I squinted and moved parts of a skeleton as if I knew what I was doing. ‚ÄúThe remains appear to be early Anglo-Settlers,‚Äù I said that, but I only reached that conclusion contextually. There was nothing in the single skull I looked at to be sure. I would need time, daylight and finally some lab work to figure this out.

I had Meredith and Casey pack up the valuable things that we wouldn‚Äôt leave overnight and soon we were back in the car driving to our bed and breakfast. 

\_\_\_\_\_ 

The town was nestled at the end of a dirt road. A dead-end sign sat shot, pocked with bullet holes at the entrance.

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶‚Äù said Meredith when we saw it. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù I said, trying to contain some anger. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just sleeping here. Kids shoot everything everywhere out here. It‚Äôs not damnatory of the entire town.‚Äù 

*Damnatory.* For the third time in 24 hours, I scrunched my eyes and cringed. At least I was smart enough to know that actually smart people don‚Äôt like using big words. 

‚ÄúWell *damnatory* or not,‚Äù said Casey. ‚ÄúThis place is a shithole.‚Äù

As if on cue a pack of pigs darted across the dirt road and disappeared behind a derelict chapel. Its white paint was peeling, it‚Äôs steeple slightly bent. 

‚ÄúWell, if you‚Äôre looking for the Ritz-Carlton you picked the wrong major.‚Äù

I pulled angrily into the dirt driveway of the B&B. The house didn‚Äôt look horrible. The paint was fresher than most the other buildings and the nice sign they had in front looked like someone put labor into making it a presentable business. 

We got out of the car and all wheeled around. The town was deserted. Even though the population was only a couple dozen it was still disturbing.

A curious flock of chickens bobbed across the grass towards us. 

‚ÄúI vote Days Inn. Even semen-stained sheets beat this,‚Äù said Meredith. I was about to give her an earful before she spoke again. ‚ÄúLook at that freakshow,‚Äù she whispered.

I followed her gaze to see a man walking toward us from behind the chapel. 

‚ÄúHullo!‚Äù He waved strangely. The boots he wore were unlaced and he had a bowl cut. 

We all looked at each other before returning a wave.

He came right up to us and paused. 

‚ÄúHi, there,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe booked a room for the night. Do you work here?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no, no.‚Äù He shook his head. 

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù It was difficult to look him in the eye when he spoke. His teeth took my attention like a train wreck. Hard to look away. They were horribly crooked and the color of butter. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here for that grave aren‚Äôt ye?‚Äù he asked.

I had to unfurrow my brow to be polite. The man‚Äôs accent was strange. I couldn‚Äôt place it at all, and I had to think after he spoke to figure out what he‚Äôd said. 

‚ÄúThe grave? Yes. I wasn‚Äôt aware it was public information.‚Äù Meredith and Casey were uncomfortable and had both slyly stepped further away from the man.

‚ÄúThere are no secrets in these parts.‚Äù He smiled and again I was entranced by those teeth. ‚ÄúBut I knew there was a grave out there long before yous all dug it up. It‚Äôs a legend here.‚Äù

I wanted this hillbilly to leave us alone, but now I was more intrigued. I stepped towards him. 

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs that?‚Äù

He sighed as if pleased he got to tell his story. ‚ÄúThis place had a name that‚Äôs been long forgotten. Far Wales. That‚Äôs what the settlers called it when they first came here all those hundreds of years ago. Thing is they weren‚Äôt alone in these woods. There were others living here. Spirts, demons, you pick a name, but they weren‚Äôt human. They looked it though. Skinwalkers of some sort.‚Äù 

The man paused and seemed to wipe a grin off his face. ‚ÄúAnyhow instead of leaving here when they found they weren‚Äôt here first the people did what those new countrymen did best; they invited them all to a dinner in a shack, locked the doors and burnt the place to the ground. They buried their remains somewhere out in the woods.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it looks like your town‚Äôs folk lore is somewhat accurate.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh, I know. But that‚Äôs not the interesting part. The legend went on to say that one of them didn‚Äôt die right away. He lived, at least long enough to talk to his killers.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd he say?‚Äù Meredith and Casey were now leaning forward to listen. 

‚ÄúHe said that if their bones were ever to see the light of day, his people would grow flesh like trees do leaves. And that they‚Äôd rise up from the dirt and slaughter those townsmen. Slaughter everyone. Every last settler of this new world.‚Äù 

I saw a couple of women in the window of the church. They laughed when I caught their eye and ducked beneath the sill. 

My cheeks flushed and I exhaled like a bull. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested in that kind of nonsense. Flesh does not photosynthesize. Skin, hair, a consciousness, these things are created by cells and‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all good.‚Äù The man held up his hands to stop me. ‚ÄúI was just telling you a story. No need to get all‚Ä¶ specific.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I said. Meredith gave me a little eyeroll as if to say *asshole.* 

‚ÄúJust be warned. The sun was shining awful bright today,‚Äù he smiled. ‚ÄúAnd the day before, too.‚Äù

I opened my mouth, but Meredith cut me off. ‚ÄúWe appreciate the heads up. We really do.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI thought ya might.‚Äù He bowed his head and sauntered off. ‚ÄúGood day now.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood day,‚Äù said Casey somewhat sarcastically. 

When the man was out of earshot I whipped around. ‚ÄúYou two are ok playing along with that nonsense?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it means not being murdered in my sleep,‚Äù said Casey. ‚ÄúAnd after that spiel and what the cops thought of this place‚Ä¶ You can stay here, but I‚Äôm staying in Walhalla.‚Äù

‚ÄúHolla,‚Äù said Meredith in agreement. 

‚ÄúOk, fine,‚Äù I was fuming but trying to keep my cool. Trying not to be the twice divorced grump I was inevitably becoming. ‚ÄúBut if you‚Äôre taking my car, you‚Äôll be back at the crack of dawn to take me to the site.‚Äù

‚ÄúDone. We‚Äôll fill her up for you, too.‚Äù

I should‚Äôve left with them. Although the doors to the B&B were unlocked there was no one there. I rang the little bell, but no one came to greet me. Too proud to call them back for a ride, I took one of the second-floor rooms, and barricaded the door shut behind me. 

\_\_\_\_\_ 

I slept fine, surprisingly. Although I didn‚Äôt want to admit it, that ghost town and the bowl cut man‚Äôs rantings made me feel like a scared child. 

The only problem is that when I woke at sunrise, Meredith and Casey weren‚Äôt there. 

I stepped onto the front porch of the bed and breakfast. The town was as empty as the evening before. Just some stray animals here and there. The same chickens and a skeptical border collie inspecting me from a distance. 

I pulled out my phone and called Meredith and then Casey. No answer. The sun got higher and dawn was long gone as I began walking down the road. 

I passed the trailhead parking lot and stared at where the trail began. It was as if there were a door into the forest. A patch of empty space in the otherwise impenetrable wall of woods.

And that door was waving to me. The wind was blowing hard now. The leaves and branches swaying to and fro, entrancing. I stopped walking. 

Somehow, I‚Äôd hardly noticed it, my car was in the parking lot. I was fuming. Did they really not even bother driving the extra five minutes to pick me up? 

I rushed towards the trail in a huff and charged through the brush to the burial site. By the time I got there my skin was scratched up horribly and I was panting. I was confused but thankful that the grave site was empty. Meredith and Casey would‚Äôve seen me in that sorry state and pitied me as some pathetic old man.

I stood with my hands on my hips and narrowed my eyes at the bodies. Meredith and Casey were probably just sleeping off a hangover in Walhalla. We‚Äôd left the tarp, some dig brushes, and I had a pair of latex gloves in my pocket. I could get to work. 

I knelt and began digging through the bodies. Unlike many older specimens I‚Äôd worked with the bones weren‚Äôt flaky or fragile and falling apart in my hands. 

I lifted and moved a ribcage. Under it was a piece of burned navy cotton. I began unraveling it carefully. You can imagine my confusion when I saw it was a modern design. A crew collar. It even had a tag. 

It was a sweater from Gap. 

I tossed it aside and started picking through the bones in a panic. This one still had flesh on it. Not yet decomposed. Another was still *warm*. 

I pictured the empty town of Pleasant Falls. A ghost town that was supposed to have two dozen residents. *How many bodies were in this grave?* Close to 24, I thought. 

I looked further out into the grave and started counting skulls. But I paused a moment later and stood. 

There was blood. Fresh blood on top of the grave. It was still dripping from the sky. I slowly looked up.

Hung in the trees were the flayed bodies of Meredith and Casey. They were naked. Their mouths red ovals like they‚Äôd died screaming. 

What happened then was a blur. I ran back through the woods, the whole time thinking about the man with the bowl cut we‚Äôd seen in town. The man that seemed like he was pulled from the 1600‚Äôs. 

He was playing with us the whole time. The legend he had told had already come true. 

The words rang in my head. 

*‚ÄúThe sun was shining awfully bright today. And the day before.‚Äù* 

*His* bones were the one‚Äôs originally buried there. His people. Demons or Skinwalkers. 

They murdered the entire town of Pleasant Falls and stuffed them in the very grave they had been buried in. 

I think they let me live so I could tell you. 

So, I could try to warn you. 

They‚Äôre going to kill everyone on this continent. I know they are. 

And they‚Äôre [coming](https://www.reddit.com/r/thespookyplace/)."

\- installed PoE (wanted to try it again after years)

\- when logging in, message popped up saying ""banned by administrator""

\- went to the site and used the ""ban appeal"" to ask for more information on the ban

\- doing so made me fail the ban appeal

\- realize on the website someone else's email is tied to it (my steam is still tethered), there's a new character on my account higher level than when I left it, my stash has new stuff in it

\- okay, my account was compromised, what do I do now?

\- can't contact support, can't post in forum, emailing GGG support directs me to do a ban appeal (can't do another one)

\- made a new PoE account and tried to make a forum post, it was moved/deleted

\- joined the reddit and made a post outlining exactly what happened, post was deleted

I don't want my account back at this point. I never want to play this game again. I just want people to know that this exact situation leads you to a complete lockout of support, and it has been very frustrating. A couple posts before that thread was deleted said they usually got great support from GGG when they've had troubles, and I don't doubt that. That's not what I've experienced."

Riot Blockchain,Buttcoin,501,x5wrqy,https://twitter.com/RiotBlockchain,136,1662323095.0,"Howdy, folks! I love this subreddit & wanted to make a post to inform you about a personal battle we're fighting against crypto/ bitcoin/ proof-of-waste.

On April 27th, the mayor of Corsicana Texas announced the ""world's largest bitcoin mine"" was going to be built in Navarro county by Riot Blockchain. 

Through records requests & lots of research & info from sources like DigiEconomist & medianista.com, we found out that: 

Riot blockchain is sales tax exempt 

Has 100% property tax abatements on $62 million dollars worth of land in their Rockdale facility already up & running

They got a sweetheart fixed rate energy deal of 2.5 cents kwh until the year 2030

They worked in secret for five months to secure the deal before going public because they knew we'd hate it

They get paid to power down during peak hours & they sell the energy they got at a discount, back to the grid at a premium!  (9.5 million in July) 

They lost $366,000,000 in Q2

They're being sued for $50,000,000 

Riot started working on the new site here in secret, only went public when we visited the site & heard the work being done.

They are literally in violation of the law rn bc they didn't get the *one* permit they're responsible for:  storm water runoff.  We checked with TCEQ & they didn't pull it. 

They refused to disclose how much water they want to use, but the city kept saying they were going to sell $2 million a years worth, so there had to be a gallon figure, right? 

Our records request showed they want 1.4 million gallons a day! While we're in a severe drought! 

Thankfully, bitcoin has crashed again & they're absolutely floundering with their finances, but we can't sit back & relax until we know for certain they're not gonna clear cut those 265 acres for nothing. 

We also want to make folks aware, especially in Texas, that these corporations are parasites trying to sneak into our communities to exploit our resources, at great cost to all of us. 

Check out our twitter pinned post for more details (this is my personal reddit account lol) https://twitter.com/CCofNavarro/status/1550486272787070976

We've gotten over 1,000 signatures on our petition & over 650 gold in our local organizing group. And we joined a national coalition of other grassroots orgs fighting proof-of-waste ""mines"" in their hometowns.

Thanks & love y'alls spite & malice.  These folks really do deserve a special level in hell for the shameless, naked greed under which they operate. Entire communities be damned, they've got pretend money to ""mine"" & hoard."

So several years ago, my friend, we'll call him Boris, and I would always help each other do the spring cleanup for our properties. This included taking out damaged trees, preparing garden plots, and taking care of our weed infested yards.

I was going to be first on the cleanup detail so I prepared tools and implements the Friday before the big clean up was to happen. Sharpening tools and chainsaw chains, lawn mower blade, and just getting everything in order. Among those tasks was mixing had with 2 cycle oil. Finished up kind of late and generally put things away for the next day.

The next morning Boris shows up with coffee and biscuits around 8 AM. As we were sitting on his tailgate enjoying breakfast, my neighbors ride by in their beat to hell Chevy cavalier smoking like a freight train. We will call them Rocky and Bullwinkle. Boris and I made the usual jokes about the amount of smoke pouring from the exhaust. Damn, bet they go to the gas station and fill up with oil and check the gas. We soon finished breakfast and thought no more about it.

As we begin to get the tools laid out and has out a plan of attack, I can not find my gas cans. No mixed gas, regular gas, or a gas can in general. That's when it dawned on us why the car Rocky and Bullwinkle we're driving was smoking so bad. I'm pissed to say the least.

Well, all Boris and I could do was go shopping for gas cans, gas, and more 2 cycle oil. After we returned, we saw Rocky and Bullwinkle pass by several times, but all in all, we got a lot done. The next weekend we dedicated to clean up at Boris's.

A weekend or two go by and we have a family dinner at my wife's, Rocky and Bullwinkle's grand parents. Toward the latter part of the evening we were having a few drinks. Most people had left and myself and wife's grandfather were shooting the breeze when I had to take a leak. As I was doing so, I saw a gas can with very distinct paint on it. I inquired from the old man about how it came into his possession and he stated Rocky and Bullwinkle left it there. I simply explained it was mine as was another and loaded them in my truck.

It ate at me every time that pos car with my post neighbors went by. So I hatched a plan from a rotten egg. I went and bought a few gallons of gas, a few gallons of diesel fuel, and some other various oils. I made a concoction of these different chemicals and filled my new 6 gallon gas can I had to purchase. With some clean gas, I fill the lawn mower and cut some grass that evening making sure Rocky and Bullwinkle saw me. Then I put everything away but forgot and left that rotten egg gas can out.

I got up and went to work the next morning and didn't even think to check on the can. But when I got home, I checked and it was gone. My wife informed me that my plan must have worked as she watched Rocky and Bullwinkle go in and out with the car not only smoking, but spitting and sputtering as well. The last time they rode out, they didn't ride back in. Hmm.

They gave me about an hour of peace before they came over and wanted to know if I could look at the car and see what was wrong. If it could not be fixed on the side of the road, maybe tow it home. My response? I've had a long day and have a migraine. Maybe tomorrow. I saw the panic set in when I told them that. That's when they told me the had no insurance and it was on a main road. Tough luck.

So the highway patrol did run across it and had it towed. It was going to cost them around $500 to get it out of impound plus they had to have current registration and insurance. Car wasn't worth it.

Well, their those type of people that good luck just falls on them and the pastor for a local church gave them an old for Taurus. Took me a few cans of rotten egg gas but I got the motor to lock up after about a month. This time it quit in their grandparents yard. So, they scrapped it and as luck would have it, they got their income tax returns. They bought a nice looking Ford f150 but it began having problems too. Smoked really bad. They did take it to a mechanic that eventually found the problem. He got the truck running right again for about $1,500 and I have never had anymore gas come up missing. Thanks for reading."

Securities and Commodities Fraud 18 U.S. Code Statute 1348,Superstonk,6176,x5sgk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x5sgk2/here_is_the_securities_fraud_law_broken_by_the/,305,1662312272.0,"This is the definition of Securities and Commodities Fraud according to the Law

Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice‚Äî
(1) to defraud any person in connection with any commodity for future delivery, or any option on a commodity for future delivery, or any security of an issuer with a class of securities registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78l) or that is required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o(d)); or
(2) to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any money or property in connection with the purchase or sale of any commodity for future delivery, or any option on a commodity for future delivery, or any security of an issuer with a class of securities registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78l) or that is required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o(d));
shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned not more than 25 years, or both.

The DTCC meets the criteria under section 15 U.S. 78 of the Securities exchange Act That they are required to file reports. 

Under section (2) it states that it is fraud to obtain by fraudulent pretenses property in  connection with any security of an issuer. So if the DTCC received shares from GameStop for a dividend, issued a split instead, and did not return those shares, it is SECURITIES FRAUD. 

We know that GameStop issued shares to Computershare for a Dividend, and Computershare sent those shares to the DTCC. 

We know that the DTCC did not issue the Dividend and ordered a Forward Split. The shares that the DTCC received from GameStop were obtained fraudulently because they pencil whooped the paperwork and did not issue a dividend. 

What we don‚Äôt know is what happened to those shares. We need this information to determine if the DTCC committed securities fraud. If those shares were not returned to Computershare then the DTCC could have their license suspended or revoked under the regulation statute."

"In the Fall of 1955, the body of 42-year-old Winifred Adams was found in her Indianapolis, Indiana apartment. Despite being beaten and strangled to death with a pair of nylon stockings, investigators determined it was possible Winifred had taken her own life.",UnresolvedMysteries,987,x5qsl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/x5qsl2/in_the_fall_of_1955_the_body_of_42yearold/,108,1662308081.0,"On the morning of Wednesday October 26, 1955, 44-year-old Kenneth Adams returned to his Indianapolis, Indiana apartment after completing the evening shift at the Chrysler Corporation Plant where he was employed as a millwright. Kenneth shared the one bedroom, second floor apartment located on North Park Avenue, with his wife of five months, 42-year-old Winifred Adams. 

When Kenneth approached the front door, he found it unlocked, and slightly ajar. Alarmed, he entered the apartment and called out for Winifred, but received no response. As he ventured into the couples bedroom, Kenneth was met with a nightmarish scene; Winifred lay dead on the floor, a pair of stockings tightly wound around her neck. Kenneth immediately summoned police. 

Winifred was found lying face down on the bedroom floor. She wore a blue checkered dress and was barefoot. It was noted, however, that she was not wearing a bra. Winifred‚Äôs glasses and a wrist watch she wore, were found near her body. A pair of nylon stockings were found wrapped and double knotted so tightly around her neck, police had to use fingernail clippers to remove them. 

An autopsy concluded that Winifred‚Äôs ultimate cause of death had been asphyxiation, however she had also sustained several other injuries including a laceration above one eye, a bloody nose, several cuts on her lower lip, ‚Äúteeth marks‚Äù on her upper lip, and a bruised jaw, shoulder, and chest.  The autopsy also determined that Winifred had ‚Äúrecently been sexually active,‚Äù however did not specify if they believed she had been assaulted. Her time of death was placed between 11 and 12 pm the evening before. 

The couple's three room apartment was found in almost perfect order. In the living room, the television was on and tuned to the local news station. Winifred‚Äôs purse was found undisturbed in the bedroom and the bed was neatly made, however investigators did discover a small amount of fresh blood on the edge of the comforter. There were no signs of forced entry, and nothing appeared to be missing. 

Police were able to quickly develop a timeline indicating Winifred‚Äôs last movements. On Tuesday morning, Winifred went to work at Beveridge Paper Company where she was employed as a secretary. After her shift ended that evening, Winifred and a female coworker were picked up by Kenneth. He dropped the female coworker at a bus stop and the couple headed to get dinner at The Mandarin Inn. After eating, the pair headed back home to their apartment where Kenneth watched television for a bit while Winifred went to chat with a neighbor downstairs. 

Around 9:45pm, Kenneth left for work. Along the way, he stopped for a cup of coffee at a local truck stop. He arrived at the Chrysler Plant at 11pm, half an hour earlier than his shift was set to begin. According to coworkers, Kenneth seemed like his ‚Äúusual self.‚Äù At 7:30am, his shift ended and he drove home, making the grim discovery around 8am. Kenneth told investigators he and Winifred were happy, and he had no idea who would want to hurt her. 

Leona Hauser, a neighbor who lived directly below the Adams', told investigators that she was Winfred‚Äôs closest friend. Leona said around 7pm, Winifred had come down to borrow a hair dryer. The two chatted for around 20 minutes before Winifred bid her goodnight and returned to her upstairs apartment. She confirmed she saw Kenneth leaving for work sometime just before 10pm. 

Though Leona could offer no possible suspects, she told detectives if a struggle had occurred upstairs, she would have heard it. Leona explained that the walls of the apartment were ‚Äúpaper thin‚Äù and she had been home and awake until well after midnight. According to her, the only noise coming from the Adams‚Äô apartment was the gentle hum of the television set. 

Detectives tested this theory by sending two policemen up to the Adams apartment while another stayed in Leona‚Äôs apartment to listen for the sounds. According to the officer below, despite the upstairs officers' attempts to be quiet, he could hear every single footstep above. The sound traveled so well in fact, the officer below was able to tell when the Adams‚Äô television set was on vs off, despite being at a low volume. 

It was learned that Kenneth had been the first of four husbands Winifred had had. Born in England, she married her first husband there, however the pair did not stay married for long. She then married her second husband, Edward Long, an American soldier and casket salesman who was stationed in England. Together the pair came to the United States, however just a few years later they too divorced. 

Winifred married her third husband, 34-year-old James Lindsey in 1950, however they divorced two and half years later. A local, when James heard the police wanted to speak with him, he immediately went to the station to ‚Äúclear his name.‚Äù When questioned, James denied having knowledge of the murder, telling police he had spent that entire evening at a bar, hanging out with his girlfriend who worked as a waitress at the establishment. When asked why the pair had divorced, he told investigators her ‚Äúconstant nagging and obsessive cleaning‚Äù drove him out of the house. 

After several rounds of questioning, two polygraph tests, and confirmation of Kenneth‚Äôs timeline and James‚Äô alibi, police confirmed they did not believe either was responsible for Winfred‚Äôs death. Rumors of an ex-boyfriend named ‚ÄúPat‚Äù were also investigated, however police failed to locate the man.

Despite the obvious possibility of foul play, with no suspects or motive, police announced it was possible Winifred had taken her own life. After conducting their ‚Äúsound test‚Äù in the apartment, detectives were adamant that it wasn‚Äôt possible a struggle had occurred, and as nothing appeared to be missing, robbery was out of the question. Unfortunately, after the announcement was made, Winfred‚Äôs case was put on the back burner so to speak, before vanishing entirely from the headlines. 

Winfred was laid to rest at Oaklawn Memorial Gardens in nearby Fishers, Indiana. Sadly, what really happened to her will most likely forever remain a mystery.

The real reason Walt broke bad was because of that terrible handjob,copypasta,2617,x5kc0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/x5kc0b/the_real_reason_walt_broke_bad_was_because_of/,36,1662289528.0,"I'm telling you, the real reason Walter broke bad was because he received the world's shittiest handjob which made him reconsider his entire existence. Your wife yanking around your 50 year old half chub with 10% of her attention while simultaneously borderline orgasming at selling a girthy 8,5 inch vase on eBay for 56 dollars is an experience that people in the darkest bdsm dungeons would be shivering at. I swear to god Walter Jr. is probably having a wilder sex life on the other side of the wall with his sock than these two have had in the past five years.

So when he received his cancer diagnosis the prolonged silence was not due to shock but because of pure bliss and relief because he knew that in a few years he'll likely be dead and won't have to live like that.

That's why when he received the news of remission he was so goddamn angry. And I don't know why people see the Salamanca twins as villains, they were clearly just tryna help a homie out and spare him from this existence. Oh, but why did they go after Hank then, you might ask? Well, then you clearly don't remember Hank's handjob scene from season 4, they were trying to save him from that. Really they were the true heroes of this show trying to save people from fucking miserable, dick shriveling handjobs.

And then, of course, shit starts happening, Skyler fucks Ted and Walt goes off the chain prolly thinking stuff like ""bet she didn't give just a shitty handjob to Ted, oh no! My god, I wouldn't even be surprised if she agreed to do anal with him! While I've been pleading for years!"". That right there's a thought progression enough to start a man crashing plants in random office buildings. And the way it can mess with your sexual thinking, Lord only knows what kind of cataclysmic insanities Walt was busting nuts to while living alone.

But then Walt has a romantic dinner with Gus, realises there's at least someone who'd probably agree to have anal with him, meanwhile Ted gets paralyzed, no more anal for him, Walt calls up Skyler ""I won"".

Now Walt can be smug for the entirety of season 5, he's back on top of the sex chain. So Breaking Bad is really about Walt's sexual transformation from a submissive forced-into-humiliation-kink middle aged man to a borderline sex offender to an off the rails cuck to a pure alpha male who's ascended past sex and at the end of season 5 we can see him die with bliss on his face because he's redeemed himself."

I‚Äôve noticed a lot of people complaining about the quality of the jomez livestream. (Shocker) along with tons of complaints about DGN broadcasting quality. Maybe live productions aren‚Äôt as easy as you think on the budget that professional disc golf has right now.

I‚Äôm a local newscast director and a technical director for ESPN college basketball. It‚Äôs a billion dollar broadcast industry. I punch basketball games on a $200,000 video switcher in a 50 foot production semi truck. The graphics and replay systems are $60,000 each. We have 8 cameras at $7500 a piece. This is the cost of the live sports broadcasts you see for nfl, nba, nhl, etc..

To think that pro disc golf has the money for this right now is foolish. DGN uses a cheaper virtual switcher, cheaper Sony cameras, and LiveU units to transmit signal from the course to the control room. LiveU transmits signal via cell service. Most courses are in rural areas with poor signal, thus signal quality is lost. However this is by FAR the best system for DGN right now. Hardwiring cameras that constantly move around a disc golf course to a central microwave dish is a logistical (and even more expensive) nightmare and a half.

All of you hate on DGN cause it doesn‚Äôt match what you see on ESPN and CBS. But the broadcasts they are pulling off with a very low budget right now are damn good and have received a lot of praise.

I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick and I understand that you may not be happy about having to pay for DGN, but for DGN to get this equipment, they need larger advertisers, to get larger advertisers they need more viewers. Support the sport that you love!!"

I originally dove into it knowing almost nothing about the story (I didn't even glance at the back resume). It was recommended to me after I asked for suggestions for some good ghost stories, so I began my reading thinking apparitions and dead people would pop up at some point. I think the person who recommended it to me was right: it is a ghost story, just not in the way you would expect.

If you haven't read it yet, I warmly recommend it. Just know that it's probably one of these books you'll think about for days and feel all sad about once you've finished it.

And if you have read it, what is your opinion on it?

 Since containers have to be booked at least 30 days ahead of the loading day. He told me that for the next 3 months he has only seen this level of cargo charges in 2008-2009.

Was at my local Costco, enjoying the weekend crowd and samples. Some dude with red floral shorts, Gucci sneakers, and Lacoste polo was aggressive, getting all up on my wife and MIL's nuts to get the samples available. Then I spotted him again while I was getting 5 bags of mango bites at the super low price of $5.97 each. This dude grabs a bag of the dried mango slices and opens it up while walking down the aisle (which I have no problems with because those are fun of my favorite snacks). As this dude rounds the corner I see this mofo start stuffing the slices into his pockets! He later on dumps the package in another isle and just starts walking towards the exit. I found a worker to tell, and they are gonna watch the tape and get your ass! You're what's wrong with the world and I hope they come down hard!

Of course they should be allowed to just go when they need to. They shouldn't have to raise a hand and ask. I shouldn't have to stop a lesson to write out a pass. It's demeaning and does not reflect real life outside of high school. 

BUT

They vape. They cheat. They wander. They have sex in the stalls. They have fights and jump other students. They self-harm. They do *Godknowswhat* in the bathrooms and we can't have cameras or guards there, can we? We police the bathrooms so much because THEY CANNOT BE TRUSTED AND THEY ARE MINORS. Many of them could just go but we can't take the chance that they are doing something harmful or illegal because if THAT happens we'll get blamed for every single hair harmed on their head.

If I have to see one more post on any social media or comment in a YT video or hear another parent complain about how we're mistreating their child because they can't pee when they want I will *EXPLODE*. How about you teach your kid to adhere to one of the most basic rules of society which is that bathrooms are for using the bathroom and that's it?"

Some people on FB are claiming it's due to a Tik Tok challenge where kids are running away and seeing how long they can stay missing. 

It's been talked about so much, the local police are investigating per this article:

Ok this exploded more than I expected, and has been a bit overwhelming with the messages but thought I‚Äôd give an update. 

The attention hasn‚Äôt been exactly positive and this hasn‚Äôt been the best thing to happen for my relationship and it‚Äôs now sadly ended. 

I didn‚Äôt expect it to blow up so much, I should of used an anonymous name instead of my real name and our real ages. 

There aren‚Äôt many 25 year old Tyler Life‚Äôs who are in a relationship with their s/o for 2 years who is 20.

Unfortunately her younger sister recognised this and showed her parents who wasn‚Äôt happy at all and made the situation extremely awkward. 

What made it more awkward, and cemented the fact that it was me, is that they recognised the song. Once at a family dinner we were discussing music tastes and my ex girlfriend stated that I have an odd taste in music. Everyone laughed and pressed me to play something from my phone of what I like as music, to which I then blessed their ears with CBAT.

Her father laughed and said it was terrible, I guess we all have different tastes. Although I nodded in agreement at the time, I was thinking in my head that this is a great fucking song. 

We are over now and I am moving on. I already revealed my face on tiktok, but with the amount of hate I originally got I decided to say I didn‚Äôt have it and backtracked.

I don‚Äôt think the song is that bad and I had no idea she didn‚Äôt like it until recently and as soon as I did I stopped. I didn‚Äôt force her CBAT, not all can handle CBAT, I know it‚Äôs different. 

I know a lot have asked for face reveal and playlist. My playlist I actually burned onto a CD and have been using my CD player. But I‚Äôll go on YouTube and try link all the songs in one playlist and share. 

I‚Äôll also leave my tiktok and playlist in my bio now, most you probably seen me before I backtracked from the hate.

Callie was given so much pressure. She was the one who smiled and put on a happy fake persona whilst everyone was falling apart. She literally had to go into a cupboard and cry by herself in case ppl thought she was making this about herself.

She lost the father of her child, her best friend, and became a carer for her ungrateful ass wife (love Arizona but oh my god) she had to handle a lot by herself. Arizona literally never thought that Callie was making it about herself until Arizona cheated. Callie was nothing but supportive, having to carry a lot only for her wife to use the crash an an excuse."

√Ñr en man p√• 46√•r. Jag har varit spelberoende i ca 26 √•r. Det b√∂rjade oskyldigt med sm√• summor p√• sportsbettning.

Senare b√∂rjade jag med trav och d√• kom min f√∂rsta stora vinst p√• n√•gra hundra tusen.

Senare b√∂rjade jag spela p√• onlinecasinon. F√∂rlorade v√§rdet p√• pengar och allt var bara siffror.

Kunde spela in flera miljoner i m√•naden men spleade bort dom lika snabbt. (ca 10 miljoner)

Jag f√∂rlorade allt. Hus, Fru och barn och alla mina pengar. Blev heml√∂s och bodde p√• t√•gstationer, trappuppg√•ngar och ibland t√§lt.

V√§ndningen kom n√§r jag b√∂rjade p√• 12 stegen i Hallsberg.

√Ñr nu spelfri i ca 2 √•r men saknar mitt gamla liv innan jag b√∂rjade spela.

S√• sn√§lla! B√∂rja inte spela om pengar. Det f√∂rst√∂r ditt liv och andras."

We've been together for almost a year now and I've never made him dinner because I'm scared he wont like it. I decided today that I'll give it a shot since he has been having a hard time at work lately and he's been coming home and making frozen pizza and going to bed. I thought today I would overcome my fear of his judgement of my food and give him something nice to come home to.

A little background of myself, I only know how to make eggs and heat up the oven. I am in no way a good cook, but I can follow a recipe and do a pretty good job. I think he'll appreciate the effort more than the food anyways.

The problem is that I really don't know what to make him and google is not helping me today. He likes all kinds of foods. He prefers pretty much any other meat besides chicken. He likes his food spicy. He eats food from many different cultures; Thai, Korean, Jamaican, Japanese, Indian, Chinese, etc. I was thinking a Korean or Indian dish for him but I really can't find any good recipes that I think he would enjoy and a lot of them are made with chicken.

I should also add that he absolutely DESPISES cheese. (sadface)

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated and i will continue my search. <3

EDIT: I'm starting to think i should just take the easy way out and make him a nice steak and potatoes. (I JUST REALIZED IVE NEVER SEEN HIM EAT A POTATO WTF) I feel like I'm going crazy."

PLEASE never lay down while wearing them! They're for YOGA ONLY you need to follow these exact steps to avoid a single pill on them""

Idk it's just like... They're 100$ leggings and I can't wear them on my couch for a second? I can't walk in them for too long? I can't lift weights in them? Like what exactly can I do in them then besides stand there and look pretty?

I understand the washing/drying rules but telling people what they should/shouldn't do in some expensive ass leggings is just so laughable to me like they're clothes they're meant to be worn and used. Whenever people say ""only yoga(:"" i just know they don't do the yoga I do cus lol I'm on my mat moving around a lot with friction

I got a pair of aligns a month or so ago and I've been wearing them so regularly like multiple times a week. I wear them at work, while laying on my bed/couch, while doing yoga, while going for walks, going out and about. I wash them regularly too and I haven't had any pilling lol like we own things, things don't own we :-)

I remember I was so scared to get them at first bc of how they're discussed online but I haven't had that experience w them and I ordered 2 more last week and I can't wait to wear those also. They've easily become my favorite. They're so flattering and the fabric is just so nice"

My physique progress from age 15 to 17,moreplatesmoredates,179,x60k33,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/x60k33,91,1662333022.0,"Timeframe: I started working out in January of 2021 as a New Years resolution. My progress was slow at since I don‚Äôt know what I was doing for a few months but around June I got more serious. When school started I slowed down and plateaued but this March I got really serious and starting working out harder and eating really healthy. I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôve made good progress so far but I still have a ways to go until I reach my goal. 

Background Information: I was tired of being chubby. I was pretty skinny when I was a little kid until I was 9 years old and got chubby. I used to be bullied because of it and I got tired of it and decided to start working out.

Supplements/PEDs: I take a creatine, whey protein powder, zinc, magnesium, Omega 3 fish oil, and multivitamin with vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K. I‚Äôm 100% natty so no PEDs. 

Routine/Regimen: I do rowing as a sport and I do it 3 hours a day, 6 days a week with Sunday as my rest day. I‚Äôm pretty much working out or rowing the whole time and it‚Äôs helped me alot with getting gains. 

Extra comments: My goal for now is to have a physique like Tom Holland‚Äôs, as I feel like that could be obtained naturally. I plan on staying natty until around my late 30s, since testosterone drops around that age I might consider doing TRT then but I‚Äôm not doing anything for now."

How many believe the next 20 years will bring a lifestyle change similar to the Depression era (or worse)?,preppers,324,x5vz0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/preppers/comments/x5vz0m/how_many_believe_the_next_20_years_will_bring_a/,89,1662321075.0,"Kind of a self explanatory question. 

For me, the thought of upending our pretty normal (although food and household items prepped) life to move out on land or otherwise change our investment strategy or life plan based on major economic changes is a tough choice. We've personally lived the last probably 5-7 years feeling like there was going to be a major crash in the near future. So at this point it's starting to feel like we'll always feel this way but it will never actually happen. That said, it seems the world is unraveling before our eyes, but maybe that's because that's what we've expected to see.

Even if/when we do get to a significant economic event, because after all they do happen from time to time, will it be like 2008 where big things happened but overall lifestyles didn't change dramatically? Or will it be like the Depression where there was almost no part of life that didn't change? Our age of excess will see an end. I know no one can tell the future, and on top of that we're all a group of people waiting for a big dramatic thing to happen so maybe we're more inclined than others to think it will. But, what do you genuinely think? 

Will it more than likely continue just about the same even if there are some temporary economic problems? Are we likely to see lifestyle changes similar to the Depression? What do you base your opinion on? Are you older and wiser than I? Are you in the field of economy, finance, history, etc? No one needs a special qualification to have an opinion, but it would be helpful to myself and probably others if you're ok sharing what you base your opinion off of!"

Not because people will think I am cool. I used to want a big house, have lots of investments, become a succesful engineer, maybe make my own company while taking care of 3 kids, go travelling.

Screw all of that. 

I just want a cozy home, nice warm meal, slow days, read a book while drinking coffee.

My workmate told me that she is sending her son to private school so she and her husband have to increase the portfolios they manage. She looks tired and stressed. I just hope she is happy but she looks like she is not taking care of her health. I quickly thought that I don't want that to happen to me.
If I'll ever have a child then I am just going to homeschool him/her. I don't really like the current education system and I just want to explain to my child what is happening in the world. 

 I've realised that my best memories come from little things: waking up on a Sunday morning and just walking at the park, dancing by myself in my apartment, cooking my meals on a lazy Sunday afternoon, drawing, staying up late for my favourite tv shows, watching anime in the morning, being with my family.  Nothing beats fresh air and being relaxed. 


I just hope that I can find my way into this lifestyle again and sustain it. I guess I've changed. I know that life is hard but it doesn't have to be this way.

Edit: I didn't expect this to blow up. Thanks guys! For context, I am 25 years old. I was just dreading to go to work when I wrote this lol. But anyways, I knew that some will comment the above as a different type of success as we define success by ourselves. In this context, I was talking about the american dream or the usual success defined by society. Another point is that I do hope that my workmate is happy. I am in no way against private schools if that's what helps them. Heck, I've attended private school as well for a couple of years. I just think that the things I learnt from primary to high school didn't really prepare me to the reality of the world. I was so competitive in all the subjects taught at school that I had no life experience outside the school system.
 I wish I was given more information and direction on how to prepare for the adult life. My parents just taught me to go to school, go to work, earn money, then die. I guess that is why I want to homeschool my future child (if I'll ever have any) so I can teach him/her on the reality and not just the usual subjects at school. My parents didn't help me with that so I don't want that to happen to my child.
For the other comments, guys please chill out, I don't want to spark a debate. Do what makes you happy and healthy, if that's what constitutes to simple living :)"

Obligatory not native speaker, so sorry for any typos or wonky sentences. 

TL;DR for this case at the beginning: It‚Äôs basically the title, Game Master let Kevin rape an NPC while we other players left the room.

Hey guys. After reading through some posts, I thought I‚Äôll share with you a gem I just remembered again...

All names are, of course, changed and the story happened about 6 years ago so I‚Äôll try my best to recall the events.

Meet GM. He was my former roommate who had a big faible for pen&paper in general, in fact that‚Äôs how we met in the first place and decided to start a shared flat. GM had many interesting ideas and constantly came up with another interesting scenario or found an interesting p&p to check out. We tried everything from Vampires, over one-shots with interesting mechanics to DnD.

GM also had another friend who he knew for a long time. For the sake of it we call him Kevin. You see, Kevin lived up to that name. He was a whole bunch of problems, but I‚Äôll just concentrate on the p&p bits, otherwise this story won‚Äôt be fitting here anymore.

No one liked to play with Kevin anymore, except for GM. Kevin got kicked out of many parties for cheating, spoiling and just kevinism. In fact, I previously got a space in a full party due to him fucking up big time.

A bit fast forward, GM one day came to me offering a new game, this time the kings maker saga from DnD. He already asked several who all said yes... And also, Kevin. Hesitantly I accepted too after consulting with Jim, another friend and invited player. Jim also knew about Kevin‚Äôs antics, but we decided to give it one last chance to see if he can behave ‚Äì we even talked with GM to keep an eye on Kevin, too.

The day came closer to start and we player began creating our characters, talking back and forth with GM to best strategize what will be needed and what works best. I created a drow rogue, complete with backstory. Much work went into her, I even went back to the drawing table to create an avatar after many years of not drawing anymore.

Cue Kevin. The time we prepared was some days after Christmas, and Kevin was several hundred Euros richer which he was gifted by his parents to buy his own PC so he won‚Äôt be leeching theirs anymore (30 and NEET, nothing else to say). He of course spent ALL OF IT on rule books regarding the upcoming campaign. Almost spoiling everything in our group chat and plotting on creating his ultimate war machine ‚Äì a centaur with one ‚Äûultimate‚Äù move, charge.

Our GM had none of it, telling him time and time again how it‚Äôll be a bad idea since the first year or so we will be in swampy terrain, Kevin will just not have any fun at all (and when Kevin has no fun, his kevinism shows).

So, he decided after some days and close to beginning on‚Ä¶ a drow rogue! (We didn‚Äôt communicate with the other players who plays what, only between GM and player ‚Äì but GM ranted thoroughly with me about Kevin‚Äôs choices, so I knew the whole time what he was planning). I immediately told GM to shut that thought down too! Too much work went into my character (female drow) just to have another one (male drow) with the same profession in the party... Even though it would have been interesting to see how the matriarch aspect played out, wouldn‚Äôt it have been Kevin.

In the end it was another character change for Kevin. He still wanted to play an elf character, so he again went through all the books and created a summoner high elf, fair enough.

Finally, the first day arrived and ‚Äì we had a great time! Kevin even behaved! This went on for several days until we had this fateful day when we had to clean a thief camp. During our fight through the camp, we found out that the leader was a feared woman, real badass painted by our GM. In the end, we captured her and brought her back to our base for interrogation.

Sadly, the character with the highest charisma was‚Ä¶ Kevin‚Äôs scrawny elf, so he gladly took on the job.

What Kevin then described still makes me shudder. He wasn‚Äôt harsh, didn‚Äôt use violence (per se) to make her talk. He was friendly. As creepily friendly as a mustache wearing hard breathing Kevin in the corner of a women‚Äôs locker room would be. He started on trying to intimidate her (hard ass fighting woman vs small skinny elf) which didn‚Äôt went well so he resorted to bad cop rapey cop. Bad cop would be his summoned demon like thing while he tried the ‚Äúkind and understanding way‚Äù by speaking softly, telling her she won‚Äôt be harmed by demon summon when she would just talk. 

After that didn‚Äôt work too he became even ‚Äúfriendlier‚Äù by getting reeeeaaaaally close. He started with caressing her, brushing her hair ‚Äì to which I started to give GM MANY HARD wtf looks ‚Äì and it ended by Kevin undressing the thieves boss. After that I don‚Äôt know what else happened since the other players and I left the room to share our disgust in the kitchen while these two played out their rape fantasy in the living room.

Understandably that was the end of that Day and the campaign. We gave the GM the clear option of either dropping Kevin of we won‚Äôt be back for the next round; nothing came out of it and the whole campaign just lost itself. All thanks to some sad lonely person who couldn‚Äôt keep his fantasies to himself.

It‚Äôs now, as I said, about 6 years in the past and since I left that shared Flat 4 Years ago I also have no idea what happened to these two. Who knows, maybe they play out their inner most fantasies to this day."

Don't want to discipline your child? Fine. Both of you can stay home while we go have fun,entitledparents,277,x62smd,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/x62smd/dont_want_to_discipline_your_child_fine_both_of/,42,1662339552.0,"This one's a sad story all around, but it primarily revolves around two kids with very sad stories. Worth noting, the people I was celebrating this Labor Day with have a very ""it takes a village"" approach to child minding. An adult is left in charge of a little one, and if the little one and the adult part ways, the adult makes sure a different adult has charge of the kid. Leads to some interesting situations where a kid is MIA, but we've never actually lost track of one and have a 100% safety rate. Well, aside from trip and falls and scrapes, but that's just the price of doing business when you're little.

The first kid is Max, he's 5 and was put in sole custody of his dad after his mom was arrested. He wears a diaper still due to the trauma he suffered, and his dad feels like he failed him and as a result seems to be incapable of disciplining the kid. It's been two and a half years now and people watch Max like a hawk because he can't be trusted near animals or with other people's things. When caught he turns on the waterworks and his dad doesn't do anything.

The second kid is Alicia, and she's 4 and was adopted by a pair of my friends. She's got a speech impediment that her bio parents tried to solve by beating it out of her. When we first met her EVERYONE was given firm instructions. No using the R word in her presence, at all. For any reason. Second rule? If she feels comfortable enough to speak to you, you listen. Period. Third rule? No surprise hugs, no fist bumps, no high fives. If she's having a good day low fives are allowed. If she gets triggered she just shuts down, doesn't cry, doesn't do anything. Doesn't respond to outside stimuli. She just... goes away and it is the saddest thing to see. Sweetest little kid though, her smile lights up the whole room when it comes out.

Onto the events. Alicia has just hit her why phase a few years late for obvious reasons, and she'd asked me why she gets shocked by doorknobs while running around in stocking feet. I happen to rather enjoy these questions, and I was in the middle of a talk with her about why that is. She was speaking when Max and his dad arrived. I was down on my haunches and listening very closely when Max runs up and just shoves Alicia to the ground and says, ""Shut up wetodd! Unce OP my ipad is bwoken, can you fix it?"" brandishing a tablet at me.

I won't lie to you and say it wasn't a struggle to keep my voice even, but I knew yelling would only make things worse for Alicia. ""Excuse you? I'm not fixing a thing until you apologize to Alicia and wait your turn.""

""But Unce OP! My tabwet!""

""Apologize and then wait your turn.""

""NO!""

""Then stop calling me Uncle and find someone else to fix it. Bullies don't get my help and they certainly don't get to call me Uncle.""

Poor Alicia was just laying where she fell, not even crying. Hadn't sat up, just looked like a robot that had run out of batteries. I scooped her up and told Max, ""You stay RIGHT here while I find Alicia's mom. This conversation isn't over.""

He just starts screaming ""No buwwy! No buwwy!"" (No bully! No bully!)

I snuck inside the house with Alicia where it was quieter for a moment and said, ""Alicia, I know you're scared right now but I need to tell you a secret, can you nod if you can hear me right now? This is very important.""

I got the tiniest little nod, and I told her, ""Max has the exact same problem talking that you do, and I understand you much better. You can't tell anyone I told you that though, okay?""

Bless the her little heart she actually whispered, ""Weally?""

""Of course! Would I lie to you?""

Tiny shake of the head. I tracked down her Mom outside and gave her the cliffnotes version of what went down. Mom looked like she wanted to rend Max limb from limb, but I told her the plan. She was appeased. They went someplace quiet so Alicia could come out of her shell and I went back to where I'd left Max.

Max was being held by his dad and his dad was asking Max what had happened to his tablet, and he was just repeating ""No buwwy!"" Apparently after I'd left Max he'd smashed his tablet on the ground, and his dad had no idea what happened.

I raised my voice a little so people would pay attention and asked Max to repeat what he'd said to Alicia. He shook his head and started crying, still shouting ""No buwwy"" and sobbing hysterically. When I relayed the exact events that happened his dad had the grace to look ashamed.

""Come on OP, you know what he went through. Can't we cut him a break? He doesn't know any better!""

This is the canned response any time Max is caught doing something like kicking a dog or stealing a toy or phone to play with. I was done.

Further discussion ensued that I won't bother relaying, but Max's dad refused to do anything to actually discipline his child, just like every other time Max acts out, but this time we were done. This is so far across the line from acceptable it boggles the imagination.

We were planning on doing campfire s'mores after dinner, but I called an audible. New plan is putt putt golf and then ice cream, and whoever does the best at putt putt gets the biggest bestest ice cream the place has. Every single adult agreed Max and Max's dad shouldn't come with. They got to stay home and think about what they'd done.

Miraculously her recorded scores for puttputt were 18 hole in ones. And listening to her laugh while she tried to contend with an ice cream that was very nearly as big as she was made everyone's night.

Max and his dad were gone by the time we got back. I hope his dad gets his act together."

Hoyoverse's North America Tour is a complete SCAM,Genshin_Impact,1463,x5wx6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/x5wx6v/hoyoverses_north_america_tour_is_a_complete_scam/,204,1662323479.0,"In June, Hoyoverse posted [information](https://act.hoyoverse.com/puzzle/hk4e/pz_SkubFKLPPa/index.html?game_biz=hk4e_global) about their North American tour. 

In this tour, they claimed they will have their exhibition booth at events from four North American locations: LA, Toronto, Seattle, and New York. In their official website, they promised merch sales, food stand, booth events, and special guests.   


[They claim there will be booth events and a food stand at every city. They say special guests will vary according to different exhibitions. ](https://preview.redd.it/fi7a3a1uiwl91.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=be306a3f5922476d30a57579a0f61c3f71831157)

&#x200B;

[They say that merchandise, as shown on these flyers, will be available in limited quantities.](https://preview.redd.it/qb280qk4jwl91.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dcfb8aa2b824482e87d59e7ccf019baf7853d0d)

After having seen what they did at Anime Expo, we expected they would provide the same for the following events: Fan Expo in Toronto and Pax West in Seattle. 

I attended Pax West on Friday, Sept 1st. After seeing vlogs on Anime Expo, I was super excited for what was to come. Two days before going to Seattle, I was curious about what they did for Fan Expo, and I came across this Reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/x0qcwa/fan_expo_canada_genshin_impact_na_tour_was_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by u/para29. The post stated they only had a photo booth, no hired cosplayers, no food truck, no specific events (except a photo booth), and especially, no merch. 

After reading their post, I began to fear that the same will happen for Seattle's Pax West, and my worst fears were confirmed. 

I got my ticket to attend Pax West on Friday to get the merch at the earliest opportunity (as merchs were sold out on the first day at Anime Expo). There were many other excited Genshin fans at Pax, and we all rushed to their booth as soon as the expo hall opened, only to find this.   


[There is only a photo booth. The only event is getting a poster after a staff member takes a photo of you in front of the standees. ](https://preview.redd.it/lgsvw3pbjwl91.png?width=998&format=png&auto=webp&s=c41d921a64824651bbc7f716895fd88d4e8d32ca)

While lining up, I heard confused voices wondering why the booth is so empty. This was not what was posted on the official website. The only event was ""take a photo at the photo booth and get a poster."" We asked the staff members about what was going on, and they said ""**We are not getting any merch and food this week**, **but we will have a different poster to hand out tomorrow.""** I asked why they are not providing what they posted on the website, and they had no answer. 

Meanwhile, the official website states special merch is coming to Pax West and people should check out their merch store. Today is Day 3 of Pax West, and tomorrow is the last day of Pax. They haven't had any merch store since Day 1. 

Another Redditor [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/PAX/comments/x4f8g1/comment/imv092w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the staff speculates all the merch was sold out at Anime Expo, and Hoyo did not bother to refill the merch to sell at Fan Expo or Pax West.   


**This is not okay.** 

Compared to fans in countries like China, Japan, S.Korea, etc. that get numerous collab events, it's not easy for NA fans to get official merch and participate in official Genshin-related events. That's why when we heard that Hoyo is doing an N.A. tour, we bought tickets and prepared for flights/bus rides, hotels, etc. to come from far-away places to participate and have fun. So many fans spent their money and time to come all the way to Fan Expo and Pax West.   


Yes, accidents and mistakes can happen. We understand. However, at least they should have notified NA fans in advance about what was going to happen. They should have warned us about the situation in Fan Expo and Pax West. If I knew that I was going to get was a single poster, I wouldn't have travelled all the way to Seattle.   


I'm writing this post for two purposes:   
1. **To warn people who will be attending NA tour events (NYCC and AnimeNYC) at New York in October and November.** Yes, the situation might be different then, but please be cautious and expect that they might just have a photo booth and none of which was promised by the official website. Also, you might not be warned by Hoyo if this is going to happen.   


2. **To encourage Genshin fans‚Äîwho attended Pax West and/or Fan Expo‚Äîto write emails to Hoyoverse and formally let them know that this is not okay.** If you are a Genshin fan who attended Fan Expo and/or Pax West, you would probably share the same feelings as I do: the feeling of being duped and scammed. We spent our time and money to come to these events, just to get a photo and a poster. Let's not brush this aside. We cannot let Hoyo to treat us like this again next time. This is not fair. We need to let them know that this treatment was unacceptable and that they should do better next time.   


Tl;dr  
1. Hoyoverse announced in June that they will provide merch sales, special events, food, and special guests at events happening in LA, Toronto, Seattle, and New York.   


2. Hoyoverse only kept this promise for Anime Expo at LA, not at Fan Expo in Toronto and Pax West in Seattle. In Fan Expo and Pax West, there have been no merch, no food, no event (except for a photo booth), and no special guests.   


3. Hoyoverse didn't warn the attendants of Fan Expo and Pax West about this mishap in advance. Their official website still states there will be food, merch sales, special events, and guests. 

4. This treatment is unacceptable. Future Genshin fan attendants of NYCC and AnimeNYC at New York should know about this in advance. Genshin fans who attended Fan Expo and Pax West should let Hoyoverse know that this mistreatment is not okay at all.

Now that I‚Äôm in college and have moved out , I‚Äôve discovered the heaven of a place that is the gym, eating right, working on my goals, and a good therapist.

**Warning: stereotypes about ace people and some sex is mentioned** 
-
In short, I was in my room upstairs and I could hear my mom and sis talking about my sister's friends lovelife, this is a normal thing to happen in my house so I don't pay much attention to it until I heard this


Sis: Oh yeah and one of my lesbian friend might be having sex with her gf

Mom: wait which one?

Sis: the asexual one! Well I thought she was asexual anyway but turns out not I guess


INSTANTLY I took interest, I'm not out with my family yet about my asexuality, they are a very accepting family and I'm so glad to have them, but Im not open about being ace due to alot of misconceptions about asexuality and I don't want to deal with it.
Anyway I continued to listen


Mom: Well, she won't be asexual if she's having sex with people, asexual people don't have sex

Sis: Well she always said she was asexual because she found sexual topics disturbing so I'm surprised to hear this news

Mom: This is why I think people should only claim they are asexual after having sex, they usually havnt found the one or too young to know.


This just broke my heart a bit, my mum always said things to me when I try and hint to her im asexual and she always reply with ""you might not found the one yet to have these feelings"" BUT I never knew her whole opinion on asexuality until know, and I'm just disappointed I suppose. I was hoping there be a chance that my family would be accepting and understanding with me being ace, but now I'm not very sure."

next time it's lead and not paint.,NuclearRevenge,86,x64rbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NuclearRevenge/comments/x64rbp/next_time_its_lead_and_not_paint/,14,1662345505.0,"Back in the winter (or maybe late fall) of 2004/2005 One of my friends (Victor the victim) had an issue with bullying by Chad. I can't remember what the bullying was I only remember the most epic and nuclear of reactions. Victor attempted suicide and spent weeks out of school before coming back.

&#x200B;

So this bullying that lead to a fist full of prescription pills and victor getting his stomach pumped in the ER. Not your garden variety bullying.

&#x200B;

After months of attempts of doing things the right way unsuccessfully we planned our attack. And yes,  I consider it an attack.

&#x200B;

Before anyone sugestes ""You could have shot his eye out"" we discussed that possibility... none of us cared if that was the outcome.

&#x200B;

Quite simply we waited until Victor was documented to be at work late one night. Our posse (4 of us) gathered up a bunch of paintball guns and equipment, forest camo/dark clothes and jumped the bully in his driveway when he was getting home. We unloaded on him with paintballs not giving 2 shits about whether or not we shot his eyes out. By the end he was rolling around covering his face while getting repeatedly shot point blank.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We left a note on under his windshield wipers.

&#x200B;

Next time will be lead

leave Victor alone 

or you're dead""

  
We also took a bunch of tire irons to his car and smashed the hell out of it. Good thing we were wearing full masks because of the little bits of glass flying everywhere.

&#x200B;

 CSI being a thing and all, we used a new pack of note cards sealed in plastic, gloves and deliberate evil looking hand writing that was less hand writing and more drawings with red ink.

&#x200B;

When he finally showed up at school, he looked like had been sent through a meat grinder. He was absolutely covered in blue/black welts and had several bandages on quite a few spots were the skin had been broken.

&#x200B;

Needless to say the cops were called on the incident and there was a big thing in the morning where the cops went into every home room class and asked if anyone knew anything about it.

&#x200B;

The cops tried to guilt us into confessing having no clue who actually did it. They brought up shit like ""he could have lost his vision if his eyes had gotten hit, the issue that he may get permanent scars, they eventually showed pictures in the ER of his blood mixing with paintball paint from the welts being so numerous they were on top of each other.

&#x200B;

The guilt trip strategy to invoke a confession was a good one, except none of us actually felt guilty. 

&#x200B;

Being the smartasses we were we pointed the finger at Victor and one other friend who we knew had an alibi (work). 

&#x200B;

He was jumpy and never the same, I straight up think we gave him fairly moderate PTSD from the attack. Like we seriously pyschologically damaged him. After a few months he ""moved"" and didn't tell anyone where. I think his parents just straight up left town with the kid and he may or may not have graduated elsewhere.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR.. 

&#x200B;

Bully pushed friend to attempt suicide, we pelted him with paintballs at close range until he was covered in welts and broken mentally and then threatened to straight up murder him. And we smashed the hell out of his car for good measure."

-sadness, denial, grief of my new celiac status 
-finding this Reddit community and knowing I‚Äôm not alone!
-spending ages in the supermarket reading the fine print on labels
-the joys of finding new GF treats! 
-the sadness of gluten free baking disappointments
-anxiety about ordering food at restaurants
-the comfort of having a few restaurants I now trust!
-having to decline food from well meaning people
-getting more organized at always having snacks with me!

Narcissistic supervisor has a personal vendetta against me because I caught her in a lie,EntitledBitch,147,x60rz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledBitch/comments/x60rz1/narcissistic_supervisor_has_a_personal_vendetta/,24,1662333632.0,"This supervisor (I'll call her M) is the dictionary definition of a narcissist. Ya know, believes that everyone should be blessed by her presence and they should kiss the ground she walks on and that she has complete and total control of anyone and everyone... Typical stuff that a narcissist believes. The other day, I caught M in a lie. I'm not gonna go into huge detail about what lie she told, but basically, it's a lie she's told others before and when she told it to me, I didn't do what everyone else does and keep quiet about it. I said something to her about it. I told her that I'm not stupid and that if she can't have enough respect for me to tell me the truth, then I'll take it up with our boss. She did *not* like that I stood up to her because everyone else kept their mouths shut and did what she told them to (typical narcissistic behavior), so she's used to being obeyed. 

She went on a huge rant about how she's taking my ""behavior"" (correction: my standing up for myself) to our boss, the AGM (our boss's boss) and the GM (the AGM's boss). I told her to go ahead. Spoiler alert: she only went to *our* boss, not the AGM and GM like she said she was going to). My boss called me and told me that I needed to finish my work, whether I wanted to or not. I realized that M had told our boss that I said I wasn't going to finish my work and left all the other stuff out because she knew she lied to me, so I didn't blame my boss for taking her side since she didn't know the whole story. However, it was my boss's day off when this happened, so I didn't want to get into everything that really happened and simply told her that I did not say I wasn't going to finish my work. 

Yesterday (the day after our argument), there was some work that M told me not to worry about doing (she told me on the phone, so I have no written evidence that she told me this). I didn't want to start another argument, so I did what she said and did not worry about the work she told me not to worry about. Today, however, she served me a write-up with everything that happened the other day written on it... And when I got to the bottom of it, I noticed that she had also written me up for the work I didn't finish yesterday... The work that *she told me herself not to worry about doing.* She also wrote down that I was doing things the other day that I literally never did. She wrote that I ""purposely threw trash on the floor"", that ""I was slamming doors and throwing objects around"", she even wrote me up because she asked if I was okay after the argument and I said no, I wasn't (yes, she *actually* wrote me up because I was not okay after the argument we had). I now know why A) she told me yesterday not to worry about finishing my work and B) why she called me instead of texted me about not doing it. She had literally premeditated writing on my write-up that I made the personal choice to not finish my work yesterday. Tomorrow, I'm demanding a copy of my write-up from her and taking this our boss to report her for slander and creating a hostile work environment all because I wanted the same respect from her that she wants from me.

All of our write-ups go into our personnel file, which is accessible to all of management as well, so if M refuses me a copy of my write-up, I'm going to ask my boss if she'd be willing to pull it up herself and print it out for me as well as review it while she's at it. I'll update this post as things move along and depending on the outcome of my report, I will make another post under the appropriate subreddit relevant to the outcome."

I don‚Äôt care if it has to be her parents or someone at Starship Entertainment. Somebody needs to help Jang Wonyoung. 

I am aware people think talking about the bodies of idols is frowned upon, and I want to make it very clear that this post is not to body shame her or any idol. If anything, this is more a call to action for someone to step in before something serious happens to Wonyoung. 

Earlier today I came across [this post](https://twitter.com/pannchoa/status/1566221565813207040?s=20&t=5RWPF-5p3Xox5VfmbY7mAg) in which the OP expressed concern with Wonyoung‚Äôs constant weight loss. The comments (on Pann) took this as ‚Äòhate‚Äô and proceeded to claim that everyone who expressed concern about her current state was ‚Äòjealous‚Äô about her ‚Äòperfect body‚Äô and that they must all be ‚Äòpigs‚Äô. That post isn‚Äôt an exception either; it doesn‚Äôt take long to find post after post of people aspiring to be her size. Dismissing any and all criticism and concern as just ‚Äòhate‚Äô. 

We can‚Äôt let this keep happening anymore. Wonyoung is a great, hardworking and talented person. But the current state of her body and especially the trajectory she‚Äôs been going down is not okay. Her health and well-being is being sacrificed for the sake of aesthetics. And with how much she works, the risk of her body giving out is incredibly high at her weight. Some of her fans need a reality check when they say she must be fine and healthy. It‚Äôs not healthy for ANYONE to be severely underweight, especially someone who is so active.

WAKE UP and speak out against this. Urge her company to get her the care she desperately needs. It‚Äôs so important something is done now before something really bad happens to her. Don‚Äôt let Starship sweep this under the rug and don‚Äôt let them pretend that nothing is wrong when there clearly is a huge problem. 

And concern can be expressed without insulting Wonyoung (such as calling her ‚Äòskin and bones‚Äô or a skeleton) or speculating about whether or not she has an eating disorder (we don‚Äôt know that). The point is that she‚Äôs clearly not okay and if it isn‚Äôt brought up, nothing is going to change."

There are many great sequels to classics, e.g. I love Alien 2 but it has a less claustrophobic feel than Alien  and actually felt Alien 3 was closer in ""feel,"" but this one seems to be as good as it gets from the sound/vision of the future down to what I feel was the ""tears in rain"" ending although it took place in different weather...

Edit 6, 3:02 PM PDT: commenters have said that Windows defender updating to 1.373.1537.0 seems to fix the issue and stops the notifications. TLDR: just a bug, false positive, nothing to worry about. happened around the same time to PCs worldwide. 

‚Äî


A few minutes ago i got a ‚Äúthreat detected‚Äù from windows defender for ‚ÄúBehavior:Win32/Hive.ZY‚Äù. the notification quickly disappeared and it said that the threat had been taken care of. then 20 seconds later the same threat notification popped up again, and then went away. Panicked and shut off and completely unplugged my PC. i have no idea what this is, what do i do, scared to turn on PC.

EDIT, 3:07 AM PDT: appears to be a worldwide issue.

EDIT 2, 3:18 AM PDT: it appears that it is unknown if this is a bug with windows defender or an ~~actual threat ([possibly linked to a vulnerability found in electron based apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/wmpchx/rce_vulnerability_found_in_electron_affects/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)) but in the meantime, it‚Äôs probably wise to shut down your pc and wait for a response from microsoft.~~

EDIT 3, 3:46 AM PDT: someone commented a link to a new [microsoft support thread,](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/all/win32hivezy-removal-notification-every-time-i-run/db598180-4b74-4f19-8c1f-117d688caf91) thought i should add it here as another live source for info

Edit 4, 4:19 AM PDT: 
from a comment below in this thread:
""Defender's database probably sees Electron-based or Chromium-based applications as Malware because there is an entry in the Virus DBs 
No need to freak out it will be patched soon""

Edit 5, 5:15 AM PDT: final tldr consensus for now is that it‚Äôs a false positive, just waiting on an official update from Microsoft to stop the warning message."

My parents went on vacation around a month ago with my little sister and left me and my brother (25M) at home (we asked to stay it‚Äôs not like they didn‚Äôt want us). Coincidentally my gf‚Äôs parents also went on vacation with her little brother a day after my parents left and she also stayed at home as she didn‚Äôt like being up a mountain (that‚Äôs where they went on vacation as they have another house there). We were hanging out one day and she told me her parents are gone on vacation for 2 weeks and she doesn‚Äôt want to be alone. I told her mine also would be gone for that time period and she proposed that we stayed together for those 2 weeks. So I ended up staying at her house as I have nosy neighbours and they would rat me out, whereas her neighbours are elderly and don‚Äôt really go outside a lot. I explained everything to my brother and he gave me some money and a pack of condoms just in case. Fast forward 4 days and I just came back from the gym and she had cooked me some wonderful chicken. I devoured it all and then I went to take a shower as I was sweaty. As I went into the bathroom I heard the shower running and I said sorry and walked out, but she called me in and asked if it‚Äôs ok to shower together. Now here‚Äôs my fuck up. I have never showered with anyone before and I was also tired from the gym. And sometimes if I‚Äôm in the shower and I have to pee I pee in the shower. I had to pee and so I did but she was in front of me but I had my eyes closed and I forgot she was there, as I was a combination of both tired and kinda nervous. Basically I peed all over my gf in the shower. It took me a second to realise what I had done and she was shocked standing there looking at my ding dong. I started apologising profusely for about a minute and after that she just started laughing and so I started kinda awkward laughing as well. She told me it was fine and it washed off the moment it touched her. She‚Äôs honestly an angel for that. It was all later on forgiven by some good time on the bed

TL;DR I peed on my gf in the shower and she was a good sport about it."

The lady behind her asked her where she teaches, to which my wife answered the name of her school, and this lady says, ""I got those!"" and picked up the tab for the supplies!  

Wow!  I am literally amazed at the level of kindess displayed by a random stranger!

Many, many moons ago I worked for a very large guitar/music store in Hollywood. When a customer wanted to try out a guitar, any guitar, we were required to get that guitar down from the wall (this often involved climbing a big ladder to get a guitar. The more expensive the instrument, the higher up it was to make it harder to steal).

There was a customer that came in nearly every day and always requested the most expensive guitar. He would then choose the most expensive amplifier, turn it all the way up and sit for hours jamming. Or at least he thought he was jamming. To us it sounded like small furry animals being killed. This guy also never actually bought anything. He would just pick up free guitar picks with the store logo and leave when he was done.

One day a guitar salesman finally hit his breaking point and hatched a plan. He knew that a brand new, stupidly expensive, amp had just come in and that our favourite customer would surely pick that one when he next came in. So GS went over to the pro audio department and borrowed a fog machine and hid it behind the new amp.

When the not so talented customer came back in, GS made sure to be the one to take care of him. He climbed the ladder and got down a guitar worth several thousand and followed the customer to the new amp. Customer was stoked. GS let the guy get through his 'warm ups' and really get going on his jamming before secretly turning on the fog machine. It honestly looked like the whole amp was about to go up in flames.

GS quickly took the guitar from the customer and told him that he'd have to get a manager. The customer had turned the amp up too far and had fried it. Unfortunately he'd have to pay for it, store policy. You break, you buy.

The look on the customers face was priceless. And I've never seen anyone get the hell out of that store faster. Never saw him again.

Needless to say, GS was our hero and many beers were bought for him. Good times."

If the actor reads this I'm sorry, you seem like a nice guy... nothing personal.... other than that you must have zero respect for the audience to present that trash to us. 

It's a one hour monologue that's meant to be meta about plays and audiences etc. ""The man steps into the light in front of the audience of strangers. The strangers can't know many things about him, but they can make some assumptions..."" blah blah blah. In addition to the source material being completely uninteresting, the part that fuckin SUCKED was that this goon forgot his lines about 100 times over the course of the hour. Just as he's winding himself up to deliver some completely flaccid and non-insightful commentary on society ""In the 21st century..... LINE"" he would constantly ask for the line from the lighting tech who was following along with the script. You just knew as soon as he nailed 5-6 lines and was going on a good tangent... ""uhh.... uhh... the uhh.... LINE"". 

I tried to keep an open mind, I thought maybe that was part of the show. I asked the tech at the end, he seemed shaky but he said yes it was part of the show. So even if I give these knobs the benefit of the doubt and believe it was all part of the act, it's still a fuckin terrible play. Terrible piece of live theatre. I'm completely open to new and whacky forms of art, no problem. This had zero substance in its content or its delivery. An older lady stopped me as I walked out to see if I had asked the tech about the lines thing, I said yes and he said it was part of the act and she agreed it was far too much. We both said we were dying to get out of there by the 30th minute. If you can't memorize two consecutive minutes of writing, perhaps don't tackle a 60 minute monologue. And don't even get me started on the... the uhhh... the.... LINE"

***Jake‚Äôs POV***

‚ÄúJAKE!‚Äù I was startled awake. I looked around, but no one was there.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called out, no one answered. ‚ÄúSuma?‚Äù I asked, activating our private connection.

‚ÄúJake! Thank the dragons, I have been trying over and over again to summon you, but it wasn‚Äôt working.‚Äù Suma shouted.

‚ÄúYou have?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, are you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. I was asleep, or no‚Ä¶ I was having one of those vision/dream things again.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am going to try summoning you again.‚Äù Suma said.

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù I shouted and dove off my bed to get some trousers. Luckily, I had fallen asleep too tired to take off my pajama shirt, but I still needed shoes and stuff. I had just enough time to put my hands on my pants and a pair of shoes before disappearing. When I reappeared, I was in an uncomfortable position, my arms and legs splayed out, each one connected to some separate article of clothing.

‚ÄúOh, sorry. I suppose I should have waited a tad longer.‚Äù Suma apologized. Well, at least I was already wearing socks, a shirt, and pants. I stood up, collected the strode about clothes, and got dressed.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúSo, what was the vision about this time?‚Äù A voice from behind me asked. I turned and saw Lieutenant Datahu.

‚ÄúOh, lieutenant. I didn‚Äôt see you.‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúShe was able to secure the memory delve faster than expected, that is why I was trying to summon you.‚Äù Suma explained.

‚ÄúYes, the major wants you to be battle ready as soon as possible, so he pushed the request through for me.‚Äù The lieutenant said.

‚ÄúOh good. Please tell him I said thanks.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou will be able to tell him yourself. He is going to be present during the delve.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe is?‚Äù Suma asked.

‚ÄúHe wants to make sure his investment pays off.‚Äù

*That‚Äôs a nice way of putting it.* I thought to myself. I may not be the smartest guy around, but even I knew why he wanted to come.

‚ÄúSo, who will be performing the delve? Is it one of the base‚Äôs staff members?‚Äù Suma asked.

‚ÄúNo, actually I was told it was going to be one of the major‚Äôs advisors who specializes in Memory Magic.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about everything you said about proper procedures and following protocol when we first asked you?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúThe privilege of the highest is that they can glide the farthest.‚Äù The lieutenant said. Suma‚Äôs feathers ruffled a bit, and her sparkle dimed for a second. I guess she wasn‚Äôt happy to hear that for some reason.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù I asked her over our private connection.

‚ÄúI dislike the idea of one of the major‚Äôs closest ally‚Äôs going through your memories.‚Äù She said worried.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am concerned about what else they will be looking for while they are inside of our minds.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs there anything we can do?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo, one way or another, someone will have to perform the delve, and they will most likely report what they find to the major for him to do with as he pleases. I dislike the reality of this situation, but we need the delve, so there is nothing we can do.‚Äù Suma sounded dejected, but didn‚Äôt suggest calling off the delve.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm in love with the idea of someone poking around inside my head, but I‚Äôm also getting kinda tired of hallucinating someone else‚Äôs life.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs am I.‚Äù She replied.

‚ÄúDo you two have the ability to communicate without speaking aloud?‚Äù Lieutenant Datahu asked, snapping us out of our private conversation.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ uh, yeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúShould I be insulted, or impressed?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúWe were discussing our thought about the delve being performed by one of the major‚Äôs advisors.‚Äù Suma explained.

‚ÄúWell, I get the feeling you will not have much luck trying to find someone else to do it.‚Äù The lieutenant said.

‚ÄúMeaning‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúMeaning he wants inside my head, and he‚Äôll throw his weight around to make sure it happens.‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are probably right. The major is a good man, but he did not reach such a high perch by letting opportunities fly past him.‚Äù The lieutenant said. The conversation probably would have continued, but the sounds of flapping stopped us. Seconds later, the major, and three others, landed on vines nearby.

The set up for the delve was the same as it was back when I was interviewed after killing the wyvern last year. One Neame to cast the delving spell, one to ask the questions, and one to monitor my well-being. They we only doing me at the moment, instead of doing both Suma and me at the same time. I guess they only had one of those ‚ÄòMemory Seekers‚Äô available.

‚ÄúSentinel, please lay down.‚Äù The major said as a bed of vines formed about at knee height.

‚ÄúAm I going to be put to sleep? They didn‚Äôt do that last time.‚Äù I said lying down.

‚ÄúNo, but it will be easier for us this way, and less dangerous.‚Äù

‚ÄúLess dangerous?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, if you do lose consciousness, you could fall. Also, this situation is rather‚Ä¶ unique. Memory delves have never been used in this way before.‚Äù He said.

*Please don‚Äôt fry my brain.* I thought to myself.

‚ÄúAlright, I am ready.‚Äù The Neame who had cast the magic circle around me, and who was going to be doing the delve for us, said.

‚ÄúYeah, me too.‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúThen‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs begin.‚Äù

***Suma‚Äôs POV***

‚ÄúSentinel, I want you to think about the first time you saw this ‚ÄòFigure in flame‚Äô.‚Äù The Neame in charge of guiding Jake through the questions said. The major, Lieutenant Datahu, and myself, were all perched near Jake, watching the delve.

‚ÄúI was at‚Ä¶ that church.‚Äù Jake said.

‚ÄúChurch?‚Äù The interviewer asked.

‚ÄúI think it was called a sanctum or something. Suma and I were about to form our bonding ritual thing, and he came out of nowhere and demanded she give me a new name.‚Äù Jake explained.

‚ÄúAh yes, you mean the Grand Sanctum of Zach-Ahshem. Did he do anything else besides demanding a name?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, after that he left.‚Äù Jake said. The interviewer looked over to the other two Neame, they each nodded and he continued the questions.

‚ÄúAnd when was your next encounter?‚Äù

‚ÄúA month or two later, I think. He was able to catch me in-between being summoned.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you explain what you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúSuma summoned me so that we could name my weapons, but he interrupted it and pulled me somewhere.‚Äù Jake said.

‚ÄúWhere? Do you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt felt like a dream‚Ä¶ I was floating in a void, and there was this light. I went to it, and it was him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did he do this time?‚Äù The interviewer asked.

‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶ threatened me, and told me we were friends. He really didn‚Äôt make any sense that time, or any time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know one mage in the modern era capable of interrupting a summoning.‚Äù The major whispered to the lieutenant.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably because none exist anymore, and haven‚Äôt in several hundred years.‚Äù She answered.

‚ÄúDid you see the being again after that?‚Äù The interviewer asked Jake, not minding the major and Lieutenant‚Äôs conversation.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe interrupted a summons again, but going the other way this time. Suma was sending me back home. We had been exploring a cave during a training exercise for training camp. It was too small for me, so she sent me back.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what did he do this time?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe said‚Ä¶ I was standing on his head.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you know what he meant?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe never figured it out.‚Äù Jake said. The major looked nervous, and interrupted the delve with a question of his own.

‚ÄúWhat exactly did he say?‚Äù The major sounded upset, concerned even. I thought maybe it had to do with military matters, but the lieutenant looked as confused and surprised by his sudden outburst as the interviewer was.

‚ÄúUm, I don‚Äôt remember exactly. Just that I was standing on his head, and that I had never been closer, and then he suddenly said I was far away.‚Äù The major did not look satisfied with Jake‚Äôs answer, but he did not ask any follow-ups.

‚ÄúAbout how many more times did you meet the figure after that?‚Äù The interviewer asked.

‚ÄúA few more.‚Äù Jake said.

‚ÄúAnd do any of them stand out to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. There was only one time where he actually did anything to me. That‚Äôs when all this hallucination stuff started.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs go ahead and move to that instance. What can you tell me about what happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt started off like any of the other ones. He said things that didn‚Äôt make any sense, then said I was getting stronger.‚Äù Jake said.

‚ÄúWhat made this time different then? Did he hurt you somehow?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. He did something, and my head felt like it was going to explode.‚Äù

‚ÄúAHH!‚Äù One of the assistants started to scream. She collapsed to the floor and the other two quickly flew over to her. Jake sat up and watched.

‚ÄúWhat happened? Are you okay?‚Äù The interviewer asked.

‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶ it suddenly‚Ä¶ it felt like I was watching thousands of memories all playing out at the same time.‚Äù The assistant answered weakly.

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs what it felt like it me the first time too.‚Äù Jake said.

‚ÄúWe had theorized that the figure had implanted memories into Jake, and that is what has been causing all of this.‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúMemory Magic being used to forcibly push memories into someone‚Äôs mind? I have heard of things like that before, but it fell out of practice over two hundred years ago.‚Äù Lieutenant Datahu whispered. The major nodded his head.

‚ÄúSo, does that mean we need to stop?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI can continue.‚Äù The assistant, who had gotten back up, answered.

‚ÄúThis is what we came to do.‚Äù The major said.

‚ÄúAlright then‚Ä¶‚Äù The interviewer said hesitantly, and looked at his assistant after going back to his perch. ‚ÄúSentinel, I want you to focus on one of the memories that were placed into you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich one?‚Äù Jake asked.

‚ÄúYou mentioned you had already seen some of them play out. Try focusing on one of those.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe first time it happened, I was buying food at the store. I saw a Neame named Ambos, and I thought I was a guy named Zachariah.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmbos‚Ä¶? And Zachariah you said? Can you tell me anything about them?‚Äù The interviewer asked surprised. I couldn‚Äôt blame him; everyone knows the name Ambos. We live in the country of Ambos after all.

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ Ambos likes raisins, and Zachariah was very sarcastic. Beyond that, not much. I know Zachariah killed a lot of Neame in the war, and in some pretty violent ways apparently. I also know he was a familiar to Ambos, just like I am to Suma.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas he a Viking?‚Äù The lieutenant asked.

‚ÄúHe may have been. He was the same species at least, but you can‚Äôt tell just by looking.‚Äù Jake answered.

‚ÄúNo?‚Äù The major asked.

‚ÄúCould you tell what nation a Neame was just by the color of their feathers?‚Äù Jake asked, sounding a tad annoyed.

The major looked at the lieutenant for a moment, then answered, ‚ÄúI suppose that is a fair point.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you could tell he was the same species, right?‚Äù The lieutenant asked.

‚ÄúYes, that I could tell.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyway Sentinel,‚Äù the interviewer interrupted. ‚ÄúA Viking familiar with a master named Ambos. This cannot be a coincidence.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is true.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI had a suspicion from the beginning, but this does confirm it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd really appreciate if you guys started speaking in complete thoughts; thanks.‚Äù Jake complained.

‚ÄúSentinel, do you not know of Ambos?‚Äù The major asked.

‚ÄúUm, a little. Only what Suma has told me though. He was like some kind of hero mage, who may or may not have slayed the Death Dragon. That Ambos?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, most likely.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ we think I have the hero‚Äôs familiar‚Äôs memories in my head?‚Äù Jake asked.

‚ÄúSentinel, when someone implants their memories into another person in the way that this ‚ÄòFigure of Flame‚Äô did, it doesn‚Äôt just put their memories into them. Their thoughts, emotions, worries, even their desires. It puts a piece of them into you as well.‚Äù The lieutenant said.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked. Memory Magic‚Ä¶ has never been my specialty, so I was fairly lost as well.

‚ÄúThere were thousands of memories overlapping one another, and then he actually believed himself to be Zachariah. That isn‚Äôt just Memory Magic. This is more like Soul Magic.‚Äù The assistant said.

‚ÄúSentinel, I think that figure of flame put a piece of himself into you.‚Äù The interviewer said.

‚ÄúBut they were Zachariah‚Äôs memories?‚Äù Jake said, still confused.

The lieutenant nodded her head. ‚ÄúYes. Which probably means that the figure was Zachariah himself.‚Äù"

My restaurant has recently started doing an automatic 18% gratuity on all tables. Our management told us yesterday that if a table tips on top of the 18%, we have to get it approved by said manager. Meaning, we have to pick up the bill before the table leaves and if they tip over management has to go to the table and confirm they meant to leave additional money on top of what‚Äôs included. It‚Äôs not always possible in a high volume place to pick up a bill before a table leaves, especially when you have 6 tables at one time
during peak hours. As if that‚Äôs not already bad enough, starting last night if a manager doesn‚Äôt sign off on your additional tip, they are saying they won‚Äôt honor it and it‚Äôs automatically money lost. Is this even legal? I‚Äôm thinking surely they can‚Äôt actually not give us the money as the customer wrote it and signed off on it. I don‚Äôt want to say anything before knowing if they actually can or can‚Äôt do that. I‚Äôve tried googling it, but haven‚Äôt found the answer I‚Äôm looking for.

Probably stuffed at least 10 grams of 3 different weeds in it and some keef. We already smoked 2 normal blunts before hand as well before we fired it up. We put on some trailer park boys (we got a TV at our fireplace) and smoked that doink until we were well zooted.

Here's where the dangers of Marijuana come in. We decided make hotdogs on the fire. Within an hour we consumed an entire 10 pack of hotdogs and Buns. We would eat 2, look at each other and silently agree we needed more until we finished the pack. I felt like Ricky after he got high and ate 9 cans of ravioli. Nobody wants to admit that, and I had to admit that to my fiance this morning."

I'm only a fresher and I was still in college when I started working for them. They wanted me to build an entire app in a tech stack that I was quite new at in one month and not to forget I don't have the experience of a 30 year old at 22. After the first demo they wanted me to start from scratch and build a basic system that they could use. So the internship got extended to almost two months and a half. They were aware of this. Anyways I tried my best to build an app that was functional. They sounded quite happy during the second demo and said they would reach out to me over mail. I waited for a week and today saw my slack account was deactivated. I don't know I just don't feel good about this.


Update: I got a reply from them. They said it may have been an automated deactivation. And that they were busy with something."

> A San Jose restaurant owner has been charged with taking at least $3.5 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds and spending it on investments, home refinancing and other unauthorized personal uses.

> David Tai Leung, 50% owner of Tomi Sushi and Seafood Buffet, was indicted by a federal grand jury Wednesday on charges of fraud in his use of payments from the Restaurant Revitalization Fund.

> Leung received $5 million in June 2021 from the federal fund, which was intended to help restaurants recover from their losses in the pandemic, the indictment said. It said he promised to use the money to cover payroll, supplies, utility bills and other business expenses from February 2020 through March 2023.

> Instead, the grand jury said, Leung transferred $3.5 million to a personal account and used much of it to invest in securities, which mostly lost money. He also used substantial sums to refinance his home in Sacramento, and transferred other funds to a personal bank account that covered checks to a car dealer and a casino, among others, the indictment said."

Tired of the same cliche advice all the time. How hard is it to realize every situation and person is different? Sometimes the dumpee or dumper is completely happy with themselves, doesn't change the loss or the pain that comes with it.

I'm happy with myself, I recently ""graduated"" from therapy that I was in for over a year, I got my degree last year, got a high paying job, moved into my own place, exercise 5 days a week. I feel good and am in a good spot in my life.

But that doesn't change the gut wrenching fact that I just lost the love of my life. Doesn't change the fact that I no longer get to hold her and kiss her, to talk to her every single day, to just be with her in comfortable silence. Doesn't change the fact that I no longer have that person, **my** person, that I could talk to about anything and everything and she could do the same with me. Doesn't change the fact that I no longer have the person I spent a total of 5 years with and built a life with, to having nothing at all. Doesn't change how lonely I feel without her, and how much pain I've been in for so many months. I spend a lot of time with family and friends, and yet feel so completely alone without her.  Doesn't change the fact that I have always and will always love her, and how amazing our relationship was for so long, but can no longer be with her because she moved. She moved not to another city, but another fucking country permanently and the long distance was just too hard.

Doesn't change the fact that she was, is and will always be the love of my life."

The spring champions manage to keep it together just enough to secure top 3 in the LCS and with that a spot at Worlds 2022! Having to play 10 games in the lower bracket, EG will advance into the lower bracket final with a lot of recent stage experience that might come in handy going forward.

EG will go up against 100 Thieves next Saturday before the winner if that will fight Cloud9 for the LCS title on Sunday!

Congrats to the players and the org!

Update:
1. Thank you all for the advices and solidarity. 
2. Im Brazilian, sorry for any mistakes.
3. Babysitter is not a option, It costs a lot in our country. Really, a lot like 4-5k per month.
4. We cant put him at daycare until she's 4mo (ped advice) bc she's premature and fragile (born at 35w0d)
5. My parents are deceased and my in laws are crazy (cosplay of the Kardashians) so we cant rely on then
6. He doesnt like any tv shows, even cocomelon! We're already try and he doesnt watch for more than 5min.
7. Yes, I need a miracle üòÖ or just time 
8. I never spank or scream with him, I play with him everyday, cook all his meals etc etc. Im just tired of him screaming and calling me ALL the day and today after dinner I was crying of exaustion and made this post. But i dont hate my kid and I never even imagine doing something bad for him.
9. Yes, we planned 2under2 but he was going to daycare part time so things would be much better if he still was able to go.

..

I love my son with all my heart, I really do. But he's with me 24/7 and is ALWAYS calling me. Even when he's with me he's calling me like he want to be INSIDE of me living in my skin.
I have now a 1mo baby girl and cant have a sigle moment bonding with her that he will be talking to me. And hes not like that now that she was born, he is like that since he was born.

My husband take him to walk 1h around 2x per week when he's back from work and cant do anymore due cold weather or toddlers sleep time so im with him all the time.

I love him to death and Im amazed I had him, but I cant stand him anymore. I need a fucking time with my baby girl. I dont need watch Netflix or have a life, I just need he fucking stops calling me!"

&#x200B;

**Recruiting after attracting press coverage**

>Members give one another tips about where to place posters and stickers legally, and they urge one another to wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints. But in practice, Patriot Front members frequently target storefronts or places of worship, which is vandalism. Additionally, many colleges and universities, another favorite target for postering, prohibit flyers from nonstudent groups. White supremacists see campuses as a strategic location for flyering: a place to recruit potential members while attracting press coverage to amplify their propaganda.

([They Are Racist; Some of Them Have Guns. Inside the White Supremacist Group Hiding in Plain Sight.](https://www.propublica.org/article/they-are-racist-some-of-them-have-guns-inside-the-white-supremacist-group-hiding-in-plain-sight))

&#x200B;

**This is a real group, not an FBI sting/honeypot**

>The group did not ""pop outta nowhere"" as Rogan \[has\] suggested. ""Far from being an 'unknown' entity that suspiciously materialized ... in December 2021, both Patriot Front and Rousseau have been the subject of monitoring and news coverage since"" 2017, Snopes reports. Gigabytes of leaked emails and Discord server messages from inside the group also appear to be genuine.

...

>This wouldn't be the first time the American right tried to blame the FBI for the actions of extremists. In January 2022, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) suggested during a Senate hearing that a man named Ray Epps, who participated in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, was actually an FBI informant tasked with inciting the riot.  
>  
>A spokesperson for the Jan. 6 committee later said the committee ""has interviewed Mr. Epps,"" who told them that ""he was not employed by, working with, or acting at the direction of any law enforcement agency on January 5th or 6th or at any other time, and that he has never been an informant for the FBI or any other law enforcement agency.""

([Why right-wingers claim white nationalist group Patriot Front is an FBI sting](https://theweek.com/us/1014893/what-is-patriot-front))

&#x200B;

>The leak of more than 400 gigabytes of messages and other media from two internal Patriot Front forums, made publicly available in January by nonprofit media outlet Unicorn Riot, provides new insight into how the group reacted not only to Rogan‚Äôs segment but to coverage from more traditional outlets. Page after page of conversation lay bare efforts by Front members to aggregate mentions of itself in the mainstream press to craft videos designed to amplify its recruitment on platforms such as Telegram, where neo-Nazi rhetoric is openly espoused.

**Patriot Front is a neo-Nazi, white supremacist, antisemitic, fascist group**

>According to leaked messages, Patriot Front‚Äôs rank and file still enjoy doing ‚ÄòRoman salutes‚Äô despite rules saying they shouldn‚Äôt. In one direct message exchange members nostalgically recalled **throwing up Nazi salutes ‚Äúin front of a PF flag in full uniform‚Äù** at a bar in Europe while meeting up with Polish neo-Nazi skinheads. In one leaked video of masked Patriot Front members reading a manifesto, as they take off their official gear one of them remarks, ‚Äú**Sieg fucking heil!** Lets fucking go. I can say that now that \[the recording is\] over.‚Äù

>Patriot Front is a white supremacist group whose members maintain that their ancestors conquered America and bequeathed it to them, and no one else.

...

>In 2018, less than a year after splintering from the openly antisemitic and neo-Nazi Vanguard America, Patriot Front transitioned from using explicitly antisemitic and traditional white supremacist language in its propaganda to using more ambiguous messaging, including phrases such as ‚ÄúAmerica First,‚Äù ‚ÄúUnited We Stand,‚Äù ‚ÄúBetter Dead Than Red,‚Äù ‚ÄúTwo Parties. One Tyranny,‚Äù ‚ÄúReclaim America‚Äù and ‚ÄúNot Stolen. Conquered.‚Äù They also changed the URL to their website, naming the website after the group, rather than using the right-wing nationalist slogan ‚ÄúBlood and Soil.‚Äù Since mid-2018, Patriot Front has continued to build its ‚Äúbrand,‚Äù carefully avoiding explicit antisemitic and white supremacist language and symbols. Yet, though their outward brand is more ‚Äúsanitized,‚Äù their antisemitism is still present.

...

>Sample of Antisemitism in their Discord chats:  
>  
>‚ÄúMedia pushes anti-white agenda and inciting acts of violence against whites, like in Waukesha and BLM riots. The Jewish control in the media pushes the anti-white narrative.‚Äù 12.1.2021

...

>Leadership disputes aside, the split between Vanguard America and Patriot Front is symptomatic of the divergent opinions among white supremacists about optics and how to best promote their cause to the public. Rousseau‚Äôs camp prefers to promote ‚ÄúAmerican Nationalism‚Äù and advocate for a racist ideology that appeals to conservatives, using ostensibly unifying symbols like the American flag. In that same vein, Patriot Front uses an image of a fasces, **the original symbol of fascism** (a bundle of sticks featuring an axe) encircled by thirteen stars as ‚Äúan American symbol of revolutionary spirit.‚Äù

([ADL: Patriot Front](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/patriot-front))

&#x200B;

>Patriot Front (PF) is a white nationalist hate group that formed in the aftermath of the deadly ‚ÄúUnite the Right‚Äù rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, of August 12, 2017. The organization broke off from Vanguard America (VA), a neo-Nazi group that participated in the chaotic demonstration. PF‚Äôs founder, Thomas Rousseau, led VA members during ‚ÄúUnite the Right,‚Äù including James Alex Fields, Jr., the young man accused of murdering anti-racist protester Heather Heyer after fatally driving his vehicle into a crowd of protesters.

([SPLC: Patriot Front](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/patriot-front))

&#x200B;

>The person who gained entrance to the group said Rousseau was one of three Patriot Front members who interviewed him on the telephone when he applied. He was asked to explain his political evolution, to say which political figures he hated and admired most, to state the circumstances in which the use of violence would be OK and to articulate the greatest threat to America. He was told Mussolini‚Äôs **‚ÄúThe Doctrine of Fascism‚Äù** would be required reading.

&#x200B;

>Potential recruits who fail to mention race during interviews are quickly rejected by the group‚Äôs leaders and pejoratively labeled ‚Äúcivnats,‚Äù a nickname for so-called civic nationalists. In the eyes of Patriot Front recruiters, civic nationalists are those who profess a strong national identity, but are insufficiently hostile to concepts of racial equality or multiculturalism.  
>  
>‚ÄúHas read **Mein Kampf**, **Hitler‚Äôs** Revolution. MK was really interesting. Hitler as a thinker and revolutionary,‚Äù notes read from one interview with a potential recruit, who was ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù in his initial screening.  
>  
>‚ÄúWas struck by the fact that **Hitler** does not sound crazy or like a raving madman,‚Äù another recruit‚Äôs notes read.  
>  
>‚ÄúAdmires Henry Ford because he was based and got a medal from **Hitler**,‚Äù says another.

**The lack of overt violence is branding/strategy, but doesn't mean the group isn't violent**

>Patriot Front was formed in the aftermath of the deadly ‚ÄúUnite the Right‚Äù rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. While many on America‚Äôs far-right cheered the rally, its violence struck others as a public-relations debacle for the white nationalist brand that was sure to attract greater oversight by law enforcement.  
>  
>Patriot Front aspired to help chart a new way forward: spread propaganda espousing its version of a nascent American fascism; quietly recruit new members worried about a nation overrun by immigrants and a world controlled by Jews; avoid talking about guns or violence online, but engage in a mix of vandalism and intimidation to foster anxiety; wear masks in public and communicate secretly.

...

>‚ÄúIt is very common for the leadership of these groups to disqualify violence, while doing things that are encouraging violence,‚Äù Simi said. ‚ÄúIt is part of their strategy to avoid liability, while simultaneously promoting hate. When they say they are not violent, this is a lie. They are promoting violence by their goals.‚Äù

...

>According to the person who infiltrated Patriot Front, Rousseau worries greatly about his members making the worst strategic mistake: carrying out an act of terrible violence.

I got talking to a barman in my hotel one day, and he mentioned that although he usually speaks Arabic like most Egyptians, his first language was Coptic. He described it as a 'secret language' because if people heard him speaking it they would react badly and discriminate against him. At the time I just thought yeah, that makes sense, the Egyptian church uses it liturgically and you don't want to stand out as a Christian considering the discrimination they've faced in Egypt. It wasn't until I'd left Luxor that I did some reading to see how many people speak Coptic natively, and I realised that it's considered a dead language; the consensus online seems to be that it hasn't had any native speakers for hundreds of years. 

So did I misunderstand this guy? Or does he really represent a secretive holdover of native Coptic speakers? If so, that seems pretty significant?"

&#x200B;

This has been happening for so long and I've been told, or had it insinuated, that this is in my head so much that I'm reluctant to continue pursuing trying to get better, but this is going to be my last shot.

&#x200B;

In college there was a bad stomach bug going around campus, my girlfriend at the time got it and gave it to me. It got to me far worse than anyone else, I woke up one day to the worst smelling fart that any human has likely ever had. Over a week my stools turned yellow, soft and greasy, until they were more of less formless, and eventually I had yellow diarrhea accompanied by large globs of thick, foul smelling mucus. I smelled bad, had bad breath, horrible acid reflux, and was hardly able to get out of bed. My urine smelled foul, and often like the last thing I ate. The mucus in my nose was thick, I was having trouble doing even slight physical exercise. I was constantly craving sugary and fatty foods, even when full. (Eating the fat or sugar was the same type of relief as you get from when you‚Äôre totally dehydrated and exhausted to the point your brain isn‚Äôt functioning properly and then you get that first drink of water; it was not as intense a relief as that, but it is the same type of relief.)  When I finally got into the doctor, I was told that I likely had some acid problem and he was going to give me something to block acid in my stomach. I did not believe this was the case so I demanded to speak to a GI. 

&#x200B;

During the time it took for me to get in to see the GI, just about everyone else on campus had their issues cleared up, my girlfriend included. My GF and I broke up, and one night I was walking down a street arms locked with a friend, we were out a long time and sweating. She got violently ill to her stomach the following week, I have always blamed myself for this. I am convinced her contact with me got her sick.

&#x200B;

When I saw the GI he was immediately dismissive of me contracting whatever I had from another person, or giving it to my friend. There were tests for stool samples, blood panels, and a breath test, all of which came back revealing nothing. He put me on things like Metamucil, and other over the counter meds. They did not help, or if they did it was to such a small extent that I did not notice. He eventually said he thought I have IBS and there's no help, and since some of my symptoms such as the lethargy, depression etc. are general he would refer me to a GP. That doctor gave me an HIV test, which came back negative then said I have IBS and there's nothing which can be done.

&#x200B;

After college I moved abroad, I had refrained from any unnecessary physical contact with people because I am 100% convinced I got my friend sick that night, and I know that I originally got sick from my ex girlfriend. I see another doctor, he assures me I cannot possibly be contagious. Abroad I decide to try dating again, the first person I date gets violently ill to her stomach, with very similar symptoms (my guess is they were identical symptoms, but she was nervous about talking about it), so I break things off. I continually pressure her to see a doctor, she eventually goes and mentions that the doctor told her that ""your bacteria is the strongest he's ever seen."" I apologize profusely, and am unsure what to do. About a month later I get a very bad sinus infection and go to see a doctor for it. He gives me 3 days of penicillin. The next day I had my first solid bowel movement in 3 or 4 years. My energy levels go through the rough. After feeling so bad for so long, feeling like I'm at 80% of normal feels like I'm on top of the world. The next 3 months are more productive than the past 3 or 4 years had been for me. I am able to lose weight (the cravings completely disappeared), get more work done, I feel better and I am functioning better at everything.

&#x200B;

After 3 months, when I go to wipe I noticed the very distinct yellow liquid has begun to return. The amount of the liquid increases for the next 3 months until I am back to almost as bad as I was before the antibiotic. I see another GI, he said that the country I'm in does not use antibiotics the same was as others, 3 days was too short, and he's putting me on 2 weeks of antibiotics. I go through the same process: 3 months of feeling great followed by 3 months of decline. The doctor is confused, suggests I have an endoscopy and colonoscopy, I agree. Both find polyps which are non cancerous and removed, but nothing else. He also does not believe that what I have is contagious or was caught from someone else. He puts me on antibiotics again. I repeat this cycle for years. It makes me feel better, but at the same time with each cycle, my ""normal"" stools are not as normal during the 3 months after the antibiotics. I was being prescribed amoxicillin. 

&#x200B;

After a long enough time, I convince myself that the doctors are right, I rationalize how I could have gotten sick, and how the people around me could have gotten sick randomly as well. I don't actually believe it, but am pretty desperate to live a normal life, and maybe now that cycling the antibiotics I actually won't be contagious. I begin dating again, things get somewhat serious and I move in with her and her dog. During one of the later months of my cycles, both her and her dog get violently sick. Since I was actually seeing the dog's stools I could see that it was going through the exact same process. It eventually got so sick that it was vomiting up the very distinct yellow colored mucus. During the previous week I had been trying to get him an antibiotic but the vet kept wanting to try other things. I demand the vet give an antibiotic to the dog, he is better within a few days. My girlfriend at the time, was having the same problems as myself, her doctor will not give her an antibiotic. She also mentions that she's stopped having her period, this lasts for months. I break things off again, try my hardest to get her an antibiotic, which she is eventually able to do. She said her stools went back to normal shortly after, but it took months for her to get her period back. I contact the ex who I am convinced I got sick, she said she had identical, included not having her period for months.

&#x200B;

Pretty desperate on what to do, I decide to fly to another country for an FMT. It goes incredibly well. Between the antibiotics and the FMT, I have an incredible 6 months of feeling normal. before the yellow liquid begins showing after my bowel movements. I decide that I've been told by too many GIs that I'm not contagious, that I just have IBS so I am going to fly home and see an infectious diseases doctor. The doctor is dismissive and says that now that I've had the FMT I'm probably fine, and gives me their card. (It was very clear they did not believe I had anything contagious to begin with.) Now that I am back in America, no doctor is willing to prescribe antibiotics to me, so I have been sick like this since covid started with one exception. I was able to get rifamixin once, and had 3 months of feeling normal. I go to a GI with my symptoms hoping they will give me more rifaximin, but instead they want to do a colonoscopy. The colonoscopy has more polyps, but otherwise nothing. I do more of the same tests I had already done a half dozen times, they come back showing nothing.  

&#x200B;

I took care of my friend's dog in March, the dog knows me well and was excited to be with me, there was no anxiety or something. 4 days into watching her, she has a yellow, soft stool. She then progresses through the phases until she's having bowel movements of pure, foul smelling, mucus with a bit of stool. I take her to the vet, she's given antibiotics and is better within days. The owner returns and says she's been fine since.

&#x200B;

Flying to see the infectious diseases doctor was costly, and I do not feel that I was taken seriously. I haven't really felt like I've been taken seriously by any doctor tbh. I had several other doctor visits in between the ones mentioned. One tried to put me on an antidepressant and another told me to stop diddling my girlfriend's dog. Is there anything I can do here? I have been toying with calling the infectious diseases doctor again for the past few months, but I keep going back and forth between whether or not it will be a waste of money with yet another person who doesn't believe me. I've been dismissed so much that in the back of my head I wonder if I'm a hypochondriac, yet I don't believe that anyone with my experiences could possibly believe they are not carrying some type of a contagious disease. There's even more than I've written, but this is the main stuff. Thanks to whoever reads this."

Being on this side of the table has been pretty eye opening and I wanted to provide a couple of heuristics on etiquette from the buying side:

1) Be on time for showings, inspections, etc. Dont stay longer than your scheduled time and don‚Äôt stand in the driveway or right outside the house to talk to your realtor. 

2) leave the house as your found it. This means blinds, doors, lights, fans, etc. 

3) if it doesn‚Äôt convey with the house, don‚Äôt touch it. Don‚Äôt sit on couches or beds. Don‚Äôt open night stands or dressers. Opening cabinets is okay but don‚Äôt be nosy and go through things. 

4) you really shouldn‚Äôt ever ask or expect to be present in the home without a licensed realtor. Either yours or the sellers. 

5) people have cameras. Be careful about what you say‚Ä¶ 

6) generally, don‚Äôt treat the house like it‚Äôs yours because it isn‚Äôt. Selling a house is stressful. You have to keep the home spotless and often times people are sitting in their cars waiting to get back in the home (sometimes with kids and pets) while you do your showing. 


We had 4 offers without 24 hours of listing and we ended up picking the 3rd highest offer. We rejected the highest because it was a couple that stayed in our house for an extra 45 min and they sat in our driveway for another half hour. They were also talking about how much money they could get back in the inspection and just wanted to get us under contract (we have cameras). We rejected the second highest offer because the guy opened my wife‚Äôs night stand and opened every drawer in the dresser (clearly they didn‚Äôt convey with the house) ‚Äî- talk about violating. 

The offer we accepted was 12.5k lower than the highest but the guy and his realtor were both timely, respectful, and considerate.

EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION 

1) this really only applies to owner occupied homes 

2) seems like some may not know but when you ask your realtor for a showing, they go and book a set amount of time. If your realtor is telling you ‚Äúyour showing is at 1‚Äù I can see how you may not even know how long you can stay‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs on your realtors. I believe showings are booked in 30 minute increments but perhaps a realtor on this sub can confirm"

The Refund,MaliciousCompliance,1198,x5vyo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/x5vyo2/the_refund/,141,1662321049.0,"I have been ordering groceries from Walmart for the last year since I have been unable to get a caregiver and I have a compromised immune system. If you get a cold it kills me variety. I also have a broken back and a condition that makes me dislocate every bone when I move. I have transitioned into frozen dinners to not starve and I can't just eat anything. My body is terrible at being alive. So I get food assistance and the snap system of EBT uses a debit card style system. 

I have only had two orders without issues in the last year. Instead of the food I have ordered things I received range from a plastic footlocker full of marshmallows to airborne allergens that put me in the hospital because instead of the egg, cheese, potato bowls someone went ""This customer needs a ready made cucumber salad. This is the same."" It's so reliable a thing my neighbors wait for my texts listing their available free food options. This week it's pineapple mango juice. I am allergic to pineapple. 

I pretty quickly mastered the refund system. After the third time however the system started making me call. Every single time. Then I was told ""You need to open a dispute with your cardholder."" ""Are you sure? I am only missing a $5 item."" ""Yes. We no longer believe you're missing items."" Me. ""I just sent you photographs of everything in the bags. You admit I didn't order those mushrooms. Why are you saying I lied?"" ""Too many returns.""

So I call up the EBT system and detail everything. I offer the photos of every single order. At this point I had 3 they were refusing refunds on. It just took 4 weeks for anyone to actually talk to me. I had been hung up on many times. EBT doesn't need my evidence. ""We get this all the time. I see partial refunds on two of these so they'll automatically refund the whole order and our investigation team will look at the others. If they do need that evidence? We will call you.""

I woke up to full refunds for 6 orders because in investigation they decided that I should have those others too. So Walmart paid me back 800 dollars. Instead of 5 dollars. 

The best part is they're not making me call EBT to refund. They just do it now AND I know I can have a nice meal on my birthday.

Edit: I do make sure my order has no substitutions. Still appreciate people making sure because one never knows"

Fun fact: Top 9 people who have had assets seized or frozen in NZ due to crime were businessmen; 1 was a gang member.,newzealand,154,x63vkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/x63vkq/fun_fact_top_9_people_who_have_had_assets_seized/,68,1662342795.0,"In a [paywalled piece](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/crime/jarrod-gilbert-why-we-need-to-shine-a-brighter-light-on-white-collar-criminals/UUZYPUDID7BQEALQWVOGGDOUG4/) in today's NZ Herald, Jarrod Gilbert talks about how we focus on gang crime when it's dwarfed by white-collar crime (by a ratio of 40:1). The headline is from this paragraph:

&#x200B;

>The magnitude can also be seen in New Zealand's asset forfeitures or  restraints. The excellent work by Matt Nippert highlighted that, for all  of the talk of gangs, just one on the list of the top nine people who  have had assets seized or frozen was a gang member; the other eight were  businessmen. Furthermore, the alleged illegal assets of the gang member  made up just 3 per cent of the total assets of those on the list (the  combined amount of proven or alleged ill-gotten gain of the nine was  some $322 million).

The Matt Nippert piece he's referencing is [here](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/revealed-new-zealands-nine-biggest-criminal-fortunes/M5SNLJZAOX3PZ3SRQWCKSDGFIY/) (also paywalled ‚Äì funny how that happens).

Entire Gilbert article below:

&#x200B;

>**OPINION:**  
>  
>The biggest  criminals tend to get the least publicity, and their crimes are often  not considered as serious as some others which dominate our thinking. A  month or so ago, I talked about how family violence was a bigger problem  than the gangs, and here's another: white-collar crime.  
>  
>And right about there, I've probably lost most readers. But if you've stuck with me, here's why I think so.  
>  
>As  an undergraduate student, I recall being told that for every $1 stolen  by blue-collar criminals, $40 was stolen by those with white collars. It  struck me then, and ought to strike us all, as startling.  
>  
>The  magnitude of these crimes is highlighted in a number of cases in front  of us now. In Germany, for example, JPMorgan Chase has joined a list of  well-known financial institutions being investigated for the ""Cum-Ex""  fraud scheme, which is estimated to be worth ‚Ç¨10 billion ($16.3b).  
>  
>But  we don't have to go international. In New Zealand, a businessman was  recently charged with stealing $600,000 by making 42 false claims for  the Covid wage subsidy. Ten other Serious Fraud Office investigations  are under way ‚Äì and even those are likely to be just the tip of the  iceberg. Or, how about the Christchurch businessman who, last month, was  convicted of taking PAYE from his employees and GST from clients, and  pocketing the more-than-$300,000 himself?  
>  
>The magnitude  can also be seen in New Zealand's asset forfeitures or restraints. The  excellent work by Matt Nippert highlighted that, for all of the talk of  gangs, just one on the list of the top nine people who have had assets  seized or frozen was a gang member; the other eight were businessmen.  Furthermore, the alleged illegal assets of the gang member made up just 3  per cent of the total assets of those on the list (the combined amount  of proven or alleged ill-gotten gain of the nine was some $322 million).  
>  
>Yet these types of crimes don't boil the blood of the  public, nor create great discussion around watercoolers like ram-raids  or gangs do, and consequently they aren't a significant focus for  politicians. Accordingly, we don't fund counter-efforts well enough to  come even remotely close to tackling them.

>Why is this? In large part it's about perception.  Businesspeople don't conform to the colloquial idea of who a criminal is  and what they look like. And this is something of a self-fulfilling  prophecy. The crimes don't stoke public condemnation, aren't reported or  discussed, and therefore aren't a significant focus for the country.

He was paroled  after six years in prison, having been sentenced to serve the longest  term for fraud in New Zealand's history. It was a long stint in prison,  but it pales in comparison to what a serious drug dealer would receive ‚Äì  despite the fact, as one of his victims said, Ross had effectively  sentenced ""hundreds of people to great financial loss and great  suffering"".

"In 1988, Myron Traylor took a walk with his mom, but needed to stop for a drink at a local restaurant. She continued on, and he was never seen again. The police and family receive strange letters, rumors run wild- yet, the case remains unsolved. What happened to Myron?",UnresolvedMysteries,296,x5zban,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/x5zban/in_1988_myron_traylor_took_a_walk_with_his_mom/,43,1662329558.0,"[Myron Timell Traylor](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2015_32/1140321/traylor_myron_child.jpg) was born on October 1, 1974, and he grew up in the Phoenix valley. By summer of 1988, thirteen year old Myron had finished up his sixth grade year at Sierra Vista Elementary school, and was just beginning to enjoy his summer vacation. Myron was described as a quiet and well behaved boy, who loved to draw and read, and was very active in his church and school. He was a regular attendee of Southminster Presbyterian Church, where he sang in the choir and joined the youth group, making a lot of friends. Myron was also eager to go on a church trip to Disneyland, and in order to raise money for it, he began to deliver newspapers along a route in his neighborhood. 

Myron lived with his mother, Debbie, during the summertime, and during the school year, he lived with his aunt. This allowed Myron and his brother to attend a better school than he would have been able to had he lived with his mother year round. At the time of Myron‚Äôs disappearance, his father was in prison, and it is unclear if Myron had a relationship with him or not, but it is stated that the two had little contact. Debbie had a boyfriend at the time, named Gettus Leroy Mintz. 

**The Disappearance** 

On the evening of July 27, 1988, Myron and his mother were walking from their home to Myron‚Äôs grandmothers place to wash some clothes, as their machine was broken. The pair took this walk almost every night, but this particular evening Myron was having trouble tolerating the heat. Temperatures were hovering around 105F (40.5C) at 6pm, and Myron had already spent a lot of time outside that afternoon, working his newspaper route. Myron was in need of a cold drink, and when he saw the [OK Fish and Chips](https://imgur.com/a/oKpUObT) restaurant up ahead, he saw his chance. He asked his mother if he could stop inside the restaurant for a soda. Debbie agreed, telling him that she would meet him at his grandmother‚Äôs once he is done. She knew Myron knew the route well, so Debbie continued on her walk, and Myron stopped into the restaurant. 

Myron approached the counter, and ordered a cherry cola. Lena Watt was working the cash register that day, and she knew Myron from around the neighborhood, but didn‚Äôt know his name. The two chatted for a bit while Myron drank his soda, and then he asked for a refill to take with him. Myron waved goodbye to Lena, thanking her, and left the store walking in the direction of his grandmothers house on Pecan Street. Myron would always walk the same path to his grandmother‚Äôs home- once he passed OK Fish and Chips, he would cross the street, walk through a business parking lot, then finally cut through a dirt lot which ended on Pecan, leading him to his grandmas. 

Debbie was checking out the front window for Myron, and as each minute passed, her worry grew. She was expecting to see him walk up the road carrying his laundry and soda, but he never arrived as expected. At 7pm, Debbie retraced Myron‚Äôs route looking for any sign of him, but found nothing. She entered OK Fish and Chips, and spoke to Lena- Lena told Debbie that Myron had stopped in for a soda, was the only customer at the time, and that when he left, he was alone. Debbie quickly went back to her mother‚Äôs home and called the Phoenix Police Department. Initially, they didn‚Äôt seemed concerned at all, stating that since he was a teenager, he likely met up with friends and would return shortly. When this didn‚Äôt happen, Debbie continued to call the department. Finally, around 2am, the PPD sent an officer to take a report. Thankfully, this officer saw the seriousness of the situation, and a search for Myron began. 

The next morning, the pastor from Myron‚Äôs church gather volunteers by the bus load to search the areas Myron was last seen. They accompanied police as they scoured the field that was along the boy‚Äôs route, walked the streets handing out fliers, and gathered more volunteers to aid in the search. Two detectives were assigned the case, and those detectives canvassed the areas around the restaurant to see if anyone had spotted Myron once he had left. They discovered that four people had seen Myron once he left OK Fish and Chips, but none were able to tell police which direction he had gone. One person they spoke to who claimed to have seen Myron was Gettus Mintz, Debbie‚Äôs boyfriend. He claimed that he had seen Myron swinging his laundry bag as he entered the fish restaurant. Gettus stated that he was in the business complex across the street, but he had left the area before Myron exited the restaurant. 

Investigators also spoke with Lena Watt, who confirmed that Myron came into the restaurant around 6pm. She stated he was extremely polite, and extremely thirsty. She recalled how they spent time talking as he quickly drank his soda, before asking for another one, and heading on his way. She reiterated how she hadn‚Äôt seen which direction he had walked off, nor did she see anyone else around the restaurant at the time. Detectives also brought Debbie in for questioning as well, and asked her to take a polygraph test, which she agreed to. Debbie past the test and was not considered a suspect in the disappearance of her son. 

Many large scale searches were conducted to find the missing teenager, but none were successful in turning anything up. Police determined that Myron was not a run away, and most likely a victim of a crime, despite not finding any evidence of foul play occurring. Myron‚Äôs case was one of three missing persons cases in Phoenix that year, and it was deemed as the highest priority. Many, many tips poured into their offices, some stating that Myron had been murdered and where they could find his buried body. With each tip, officers investigated and searched, even conducting digs- but once again, nothing was discovered. 

A theory and rumor emerged that Myron was killed in an act of revenge by Debbie‚Äôs boyfriend, Gettus Mintz. It was well known that Gettus was involved in the local drug trade, and that Debbie was a known drug user. Despite finding no evidence that Debbie was in debt to anyone, police theorized that she may have owed Gettus money, and when she was unable to pay, Gettus killed her son. Alternatively, police also theorized that Myron, angry at his mother‚Äôs boyfriend, confronted Gettus about his drug use, and Gettus killed the boy out of anger. To compound this theory, Myron‚Äôs grandmother told a story of how Gettus arrived at her home the evening that Myron went missing, with his arm in a sling. When asked what had happened to his arm, Gettus told his girlfriend and her mother that he had been bitten by a dog. Police and the family believe that the injured arm came from a fight with Myron, leading to Myron‚Äôs death. 

**Closing** 

[Gettus Mintz](https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5367a8ddcfb9c1f4d81b7884d83903b596f09e0d/c=15-0-465-600/local/-/media/2016/11/04/Phoenix/Phoenix/636138236070176609-040014.jpg?width=300&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp) is currently imprisoned in Arizona. In 2009, he stabbed his girlfriend and her mother in their Peoria, Arizona home. His girlfriend died from her injuries, and Gettus was convicted of second degree murder as well as aggravated assault. He was sentenced to 42 years in prison, where he remains today. As far as Myron‚Äôs case, Gettus refuses to be interviewed about it. 

Strangely,  in 1991, an anonymous letter came into the police regarding where Myron can be found. The letter claimed that the boy was buried on private property near 24th Street and Jones Avenue, in Phoenix. A search was conducted, as well as a dig, yet, nothing was uncovered leading to evidence regarding this case. Police now believe that Myron was killed and buried near where he was last seen, on 16th Street and Southern Avenue, near the OK fish and chips restaurant. His aunt Sandra has also had anonymous letters come in to her home, speaking about the disappearance of Myron. One letter stated: 

> *‚ÄùHello, I am not going to leave my name, due to fear of what may happen to my mother who still lives in Phoenix. As what I have to say is the truth about some very bad soulless bastards.... Now why isn‚Äôt the Phoenix Police doing anything about it since about a dozen people have come forth? The word on the street is that Kico is a paid snitch working for them.‚Äù* 

This letter was typed on a typewriter, and post stamped from Texas, though no return address was listed. The letter went on to say that ‚ÄúByron‚Äù was murdered due to ‚Äúentanglement in the Mexican Mafia‚Äù and specifically, two local men named ‚ÄúKiko‚Äù and ‚ÄúUncle Tony.‚Äù A future letter to Sandra gave more detail, stating that these two men took ‚ÄúByron‚Äù to  where chicken fights were held, and fed his body to the hogs there. They stated that then they returned two days later, gathered what was left of the boy, and put him in the trashcan. These letters were signed ‚Äú*A friend*‚Äù and it is still unknown who had sent them. 

On October 22, 2016, after Sandra had moved into the home on Pecan street, she heard loud banging on her front door. One of the three men standing on her front porch shouted *‚ÄùMy last name is Traylor and I‚Äôm here from Texas‚Ä¶My mamma told me I had a bunch of kinfolk out here, are you family?*‚Äù Then the man asked for Sandra‚Äôs son, Martel, by name. Sandra was understandably frightened, as she was home alone at the time, and she did not answer the door. She told the men to come back another time when someone else was home, and she would speak to them then. The men never returned, and Sandra regrets not opening the door that evening, just in case it had actually been Myron. 
 

Sadly, Debbie passed away in March of 2002, fourteen years after her son‚Äôs disappearance, at the age of 45. Myron‚Äôs aunt, Sandra, still advocates for her nephew, believing that someone in the Phoenix area knows exactly what happened to Myron, and believes that justice will be served one day. The whole Traylor family is searching for closure- the closure they‚Äôve been desperately needing for the last 34 years. Sandra looks at his age progressed composite drawing at times, seeing her nephew transformed into a man, and jokingly stated that she doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúknow who that man is, but he does need to shave.‚Äù 

When last seen, Myron was described as standing at 5‚Äô5‚Äù, and weighing around 110 pounds. He had black hair and brown eyes, and was last seen wearing a red and white striped shirt, blue and white shorts, and white sneakers. He was also carrying a plastic bag filled with laundry.

A man has lost his life in tragic and mysterious circumstances and my thoughts are with his loved ones. This is the first thing that needs to be said. 

But now as the mainstream media stories are released we can see the obvious play. They‚Äôre gonna try and take out RC with the dirtiest of smear campaigns. This is their game. He‚Äôs about to be implicated in the death of BBBY‚Äôs CFO by the scum media.  They may even get him indicted and sidelined. This is their grand plan. Take RC out of the game by destroying his reputation and hope the apes will all sell and run away. 

I don‚Äôt think so!

The only thing that‚Äôll blow the lid off this now is the absolute inevitability of MOASS.

>The Bed Bath & Beyond CFO who plunged to his death on Friday was being sued for artificially inflating the company's stock price in a 'pump and dump' scheme to sell off his shares at a higher price, DailyMail.com can reveal.  
>  
>Gustavo Arnal, 52, is listed as one of the defendants in a class action lawsuit brought by a group of shareholders who claim they lost around $1.2billion when Arnal and majority shareholder Ryan Cohen engaged in a 'pump and dump' scheme.  
>  
>The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on August 23, claims Cohen had approached Arnal about a plan to control shares of Bed Bath and Beyond so they could both profit.  
>  
>As part of the plan, the lawsuit claims, Arnal 'agreed to regulate all insider sales by BBBY's officers and directors to ensure that the market would not be inundated with a large number of BBBY shares at a given time.'  
>  
>He then allegedly issued 'materially misleading statements made to investors regarding BBBY's strategic company plans, financial condition... and reports of shares holding and selling' to help increase share prices.  
>  
>By the time Arnal sold over¬†42,000 shares in the company two weeks ago it was valued at $1 million,¬†according to¬†[MarketBeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-bbby-insider-buying-and-selling-2022-08-2/).  
>  
>The lawsuit was then filed just one week before Arnal took his own life by jumping¬†from the 18th floor of the famous¬†'Jenga' tower in lower Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood on Friday.  
>  
>The class action lawsuit was brought by Virginia resident¬†Pengcheng Si on behalf of all those who purchased Bed Bath & Beyond stocks between March 25 and August 18.¬†  
>  
>They are now seeking damages for the alleged 'pump and dump' scheme, claiming Cohen offered to purchase a large stake in the company, including call options on more than 1.6 million hares with prices between $60 to $80.  
>  
>In exchange, the suit alleges, Arnal would ensure that insiders would not flood the market with the stock.  
>  
>He did so, allegedly by making 'materially misleading statements and omissions' about the company's financial standing in an effort to artificially inflate the share price,' the suit says  
>  
>'Through mid August 2022, BBBY appeared ‚Äî from the company's public statements and financial reporting to be a successful turning-around company,' it alleges.  
>  
>But in reality, it says, Arnal 'blatantly misrepresented the value and profitability of \[the company\] causing BBBY to report revenues that was fictitious \[and\] announce publicly that the company is successfully on the way spinning off Buybuy Baby to 'unlock full value' of this 'tremendous asset.'  
>  
>¬†Buybuy Baby, though, was not actually doing well financially, the lawsuit claims.  
>  
>Then on August 16, Cohen filed a document to the Securities and Exchange Commission saying he owned 9,450,100 share, including 1,670,100 shares under certain call options.  
>  
>It also claimed he held onto his April call options that would only begin to pay out if the stock hit $60 a share before January 20, 2023.¬†  
>  
>He was soon granted three seats on the board of the company, the lawsuit alleges, but had actually sold most of his shares in the company at that point.  
>  
>Instead, the lawsuit claims, Cohen 'submitted \[the document\] for the purpose of creating \[a\] buying frenzy of BBBY stocks so that Cohen can finish selling his shares at \[an\] artificially inflated price.'  
>  
>Stock prices rose 75 percent that day, the lawsuit alleges.¬†But unbeknownst to share holders, it claims, that same day, Cohen also filed a form signifying his intent to sell the remainder of his shares and call options.¬†  
>  
>It was not disclosed to the public until the market closed the following day, when shares tumbled from a record high of $30 per share to around $22.50 a share.  
>  
>Then after Arnal and Cohen filed a form saying they sold all their shares on August 16, the stock down 45 percent to $16.16.  
>  
>It then continued to plummet to $8.78 on August 23 ‚Äî down more than 70 percent from its high of $30 a share. By September 4, Bed Bath and Beyond was trading at just $8.63.¬†  
>  
>The lawsuit also claims that as the CFO, Arnal knew about Cohen's false filings with the SEC.  
>  
>It further claims they¬†discussed their exit strategy with JP Morgan Securities LLC before they sold off their shares.  
>  
>It says they 'have done so for self-serving, improper and bad faith reasons, namely a desire to profit from the sales of their BBBY shares' and 'have violated their fiduciary duty by making false filings, issuing misleading statements and pumping and dumping BBY shares.'¬†  
>  
>The suit then claims JP Morgan Securities aided and abetted the operation 'to launder over $110 million worth of illegal insider trading proceeds.'¬†DailyMail.com has reached out to Bed Bath and Beyond for comment.¬†¬†  
>  
>Arnal's stock dump came the same day a 20-year-old college student made $110million by selling all of his Bed Bath and Beyond stock - but he did so just before the retailer's stock price slumped 23 percent after its second-biggest shareholder indicated plans to sell his entire holding.  
>  
>Jake Freeman, an applied mathematics and economics major at the University of Southern¬†[California](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/california/index.html), invested in nearly five million Bed Bath & Beyond shares at $5.50 a share in July, spending a total of $25 million with the help of a wealthy pharmaceutical investor uncle.¬†  
>  
>As a result, he became a minority shareholder by owning around six percent of America's largest houseware goods specialty stores as it became the latest ailing retailer to see a surge in its value thanks to the ongoing 'meme stock' boom.¬†  
>  
>That sees amateur investors snap up stock in companies seen as past-their-best, helping to drive the share price up and making some lucky stockholders who sell at the right time millions of dollars.¬†  
>  
>Freeman, whose family resides in the [New York City](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/new_york/index.html) area, then roughly sold more than $130million worth of stock on August 16 similarly to Arnal, after the retailer's stock price surged to $27 a share.  
>  
>Just one week after the damning lawsuit was filed, Arnal plunged to his death from the 18th floor of the swanky so-called Jenga building in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood.  
>  
>Authorities say calls regarding the jump at¬†56 Leonard Street near Church Street came in at around 12:30pm Friday.¬†  
>  
>Arnal was identified as the jumper at the 57-story building - where apartments go for up to $50million - on Friday afternoon, according to the¬†[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2022/09/04/bed-bath-beyond-exec-gustavo-arnal-idd-as-nyc-jenga-building-jumper-source/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&utm_medium=SocialFlow&utm_campaign=SocialFlow).¬†¬†

>A second person, also unidentified, was hospitalized with minor injuries, according to a spokesperson for the FDNY.  
>  
>A woman was seen looking distraught and crying near the building before eventually entering the ambulance.¬†The FDNY spokesperson could not confirm the age or gender of the person hospitalized.¬†  
>  
>His death came at a difficult time for the company as it faced high inflation and a sagging economy. The company had announced plans to close 150 stores, of its roughly 900, and lay off 20 percent of staff just two days before Arnal's death.

>The retailer also announced a plan to raise money by issuing new shares and said it had secured $500 million in new financing -- but investors took a dim view of the strategic plan, and shares fell as much as 25 percent in morning trading.

>Traders on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets, who have cheered the stock in recent weeks, reacted with a mixture of stoicism and despair.  
>  
>'I just wanted make money without any effort. why I have to suffer like this? why?' wrote one user on the forum.  
>  
>In Wednesday's update, Bed Bath & Beyond also forecast a bigger-than-expected 26 percent slump in same-store sales for the second quarter and said it would now retain its buybuy Baby business, which it had put up for sale.  
>  
>Once known for providing many shoppers with 20%-off coupons, Bed Bath & Beyond revamped its merchandise in recent years to focus on private-label products including its Our Table brand cookware.  
>  
>The chain is now ditching that strategy, nixing three of its private label brands, and reprioritizing national brands with labels including Calphalon, Ugg, Dyson, and Cuisinart underpinning that strategy, executives said on a conference call.  
>  
>Executives said Bed Bath & Beyond is cutting about 20 percent of its corporate and supply chain workforce, and eliminating its chief operating officer and chief stores officer roles. The company has about 32,000 employees overall.  
>  
>Meanwhile, Snap CEO Evan¬†Spiegel told staff in a memo on Wednesday that ad sales were not keeping up with earlier projections and announced plans to reorganize and cut roughly 20 percent of the company's 5,600 employees.¬†  
>  
>'Unfortunately, given our current lower rate of revenue growth, it has become clear that we must reduce our cost structure to avoid incurring significant ongoing losses,' Spiegel wrote.¬†  
>  
>Snap will shut down ambitious projects, including mobile games and novelties like a flying drone camera, helping the company save an estimated $500 million in costs annually, the company said.  
>  
>Investors approved of the move, with shares of Snap rising as much as 15 percent in morning trading.¬†  
>  
>Spiegel said Snap was restructuring its business to focus on community growth, revenue growth and augmented reality.¬†  
>  
>Anything that doesn't contribute to those three areas 'will be discontinued or receive substantially reduced investment,' Spiegel said.

Fired as a new grad L&D nurse last day before orientation was to end,nursing,889,x5pw33,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/x5pw33/fired_as_a_new_grad_ld_nurse_last_day_before/,277,1662305828.0,"So I have been in a new grad preceptorship program since late last year in my dream job of labor and delivery. It is actually the only reason I ever pursued a nursing degree in the first place, and I have zero interest in other areas of nursing. Maternity has my heart. I love my job, I love what I do, and it was very usual for me to get good feedback from preceptors. 


I will say that towards the beginning of my orientation, I made a mistake by charting that I had given my postpartum patient gas-x when I hadn't (she was due for it, but stated that she didn't want it at that time). Sometimes I'd have to go back and chart meds that I have given when my phone would not scan the barcodes. I got mixed up that day and charted that I had given her the gas-x. As this was a medication error, I was written up and had a sit-down meeting with my manager where I had to sign documentation regarding my mess up. I do acknowledge that this mistake I made was not okay, but I did everything in my power to let it make me a better nurse. 


Fast forward 6 months, and I'm supposed to get off of orientation. I felt confident, has gotten nothing but positive feedback, and was so excited to finally be on my own for the first time. My manager texted me saying that she ""wanted to talk to me about how I felt I was doing"" before letting me off orientation. We decided to meet up the next morning after my night shift was over. When I walked into her office the next morning, it was my manager and HER manager. They sat me down and told me that they were terminating employment with me. Their reasoning is that one of the midwives had done a care event report on me because I had failed to chart temperatures on my ruptured patient during a previous shift the week before. HOWEVER, it was my second day ever using a brand new system. We had just switched from Cerner to EPIC for charting and everyone on the unit was trying to learn. The temperatures, while I had them written on my physical report sheet, had not been charted because it was honestly just something I overlooked while trying to figure everything else out. Was it a mistake? Yes. Do I believe I should have gotten fired for it? Absolutely not. Especially because, as I stated before, it was the second day our unit was using EPIC for charting purposes. 


The previous medication error with the gas-x and the failure to chart my patient's temperatures was enough for them to terminate employment with me. I even have it in writing. I was absolutely shocked, as I had no indication this was the type of ""meeting"" I'd be walking in to. No warning whatsoever. Now I am jobless and heartbroken. Not to mention we were already dangerously short-staffed, so now its even more dangerous for my coworkers. 


I'm still in complete shock. I've been applying for other jobs, but my heart and spirit are both broken. I've applied to a few jobs since then over the last few weeks, but have had no luck. Any advice? Any words of comfort? I'm just extremely emotional and embarrassed over all of this.

Edit:
It is also important to note that I had recently done a care event report on the particular midwife that ended up doing the care event report on me. 
She was a newer midwife at our facility and I watched her perform an episiotomy on a patient that was not in any way clinically indicated. As a facility, we do NOT practice episiotomies except for the rare occasion when baby is in distress and there is no other option. This particular baby was NOT in any distress, but the mom did have a somewhat small vaginal opening. She whipped her scissors out and performed the episiotomy without explaining anything to the mom. Way later during recovery, the mom had told me how upset she was that she had been given an episiotomy. I advocated for this patient and told my charge nurse about the incident, and she suggested I do a care event report on the midwife. So that's what I did. And then 2 weeks later is when this same midwife did a care report on me regarding the temperatures. Part of me believes that this may have been some sort of retaliation on her part? Though I have no way of proving it."

But I didn't retire!!!,ProRevenge,7910,x5dz8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/x5dz8h/but_i_didnt_retire/,193,1662266012.0,"My friend (I'll call her Sandy) worked at a travel agency in British Columbia, Canada. It was a small, owner-operated business with the owner and three employees including my friend. Everyone worked Monday to Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. 

One of my friend's coworkers (I'll call her Jane), an older woman in her early to mid-sixties, was a long-time nuisance employee. Among other sketchy behaviour, Jane was always scamming ways to take time off over and above her official paid vacation time. In order to make up for the lost hours, she would claim overtime hours/pay by supposedly going in to the office in her off hours ""to finish up"" work without being requested by the owner to do so.

Despite being caught in her own lies on a number of occasions and being warned about trying to claim for unsanctioned overtime, the owner of the travel agency was reluctant to officially reprimand Jane or get rid of her. The reason being is the owner discovered after she had hired Jane that Jane had actually been fired from her previous job at another local travel agency for pulling the same stunts; however, Jane had sued her former employer for unfair dismissal and had won a settlement.

After a few years of my friend Sandy working at the travel agency, the owner was ready to retire and offered to sell the business to my friend. Sandy took her up on the deal and took over the business while keeping on Jane and the other employee. Once again, just as the previous owner was afraid to get rid of Jane, so was Sandy for fear of being sued.

When Sandy took over the business, she instituted guidelines regarding taking time off and she established an official ""no overtime"" policy. Jane would still try with her shenanigans but was far less successful in getting what she wanted with my friend in charge. However, Jane still had one trick up her sleeve when she wanted to take time off on a whim. Sandy was a divorced single mom of two boys who were heavily involved in youth hockey. She would sometimes leave the office an hour or two before closing to get her boys to hockey practice or a game. In order to avoid requesting in person and potentially being denied, Jane would wait for Sandy to be out of the office to book a day off if she didn't feel like coming into work or had made plans. Sandy would then arrive at work the next morning only to discover that Jane wasn't coming in. 

Despite this happening a number of times, Sandy would usually let it slide since there was now a definite ""no overtime"" policy. Therefore, Jane could no longer claim to come in to work on the weekend or after hours in order to try and make up for the day off. She would either miss out on a day's pay, in turn saving Sandy money as the owner, or it would come out of her remaining paid vacation days. Moreover, two people in the office at one time could usually handle everything. Jane not coming in was really a no-loss situation for Sandy.

There was one time, however, when Sandy was going to be away for one or two work days just before the weekend to take her boys to a hockey tournament. She told both Jane and the other employee both verbally and in writing that they could not book time off for the dates in question since she would be away and needed both of them in the office. Within a few days of giving this notice, Sandy went in to the office on a Saturday to do some paperwork and go through the sales for the week. This is when she discovered that, only the day before, Jane had booked a trip for her daughter and son-in-law to Las Vegas as well as a plane ticket in her name to Calgary where her daughter lived. Both the trip to Vegas and the ticket to Calgary coincided with the dates Sandy would be out of the office. Sandy then checked the vacation booking schedule to further discover that Jane had indeed booked the days off that she had expressly been told she couldn't have.

Not mentioning she had discovered the travel Jane had booked for herself and her daughter, Sandy emailed Jane telling her she would have to deny her the days off since she had already been told they were unavailable because she (Sandy) would be away and needed Jane in the office. Through a continued series of email exchanges, Jane replied and outright lied to Sandy with some excuse about her daughter getting some long-awaited medical treatment or surgery, and she needed to go to Calgary to help out for a few days and look after her granddaughter. Sandy replied to this lie by telling Jane she knew about the trip she had booked to Vegas for her daughter and son-in-law; that Jane's trip to Calgary was most likely to babysit her granddaughter while her daughter was in Vegas; and that she would still have to deny Jane the days off especially since she booked them after being told they were unavailable.

Jane countered in her subsequent reply, without even addressing the fact that she had been caught in a lie, that she had been a dedicated employee of the travel agency for several years and couldn't understand why she was being treated so unfairly after all she had done for the business. She then wrote that since she wasn't being treated as a valued employee, she had no choice but to retire and was giving her two-weeks' notice. Despite Jane's threat, Sandy replied that she would still be unable to grant her the days off and left it at that without making any mention of Jane's threat to quit/retire.

Sandy then contacted her accountant, who also acted as her de facto business advisor, and explained what had happened with Jane. Also aware of Jane's previous shenanigans, Sandy's accountant told her that this was the out she had been looking for with Jane, and she had it all in writing. He told her that Jane had essentially resigned/retired and all Sandy needed to do was honour Jane's desire to do so, let her finish out her two weeks, or pay her two-weeks' wages in lieu with no further severance pay legally required since she hadn't been fired.

The following Monday, Sandy went into the office early accompanied by her longterm boyfriend to act as a witness. She put Jane's belongings from her desk into a box and took the things that were property of the business. Since Jane was old school and had resisted inputting client information in the computer database, this also included a small box filled with index cards which had client phone numbers, addresses, credit card information, and other personal information noted on them. In the meantime the other employee had arrived for work, and they all waited for Jane to show up.

Jane arrived just before 9:00 acting as though nothing had happened and greeted everyone with a ""good morning"" as she walked through the door. However, she was apparently taken slightly aback when she noticed Sandy's boyfriend seated in the far corner of the office. At this point, Jane was mid-way to her desk when Sandy informed her that there was no need to go any further and that she had accepted Jane's notification of retirement. She then handed Jane a cheque compensating her for the hours she had worked in the current pay period as well as two-weeks' wages in lieu of Jane finishing out her final two weeks before her ""retirement"".

Jane was dumbfounded and went into panic mode, ""But I didn't retire! I'm not ready to retire!"" 

Sandy responded that indeed she had retired, given her notice and had proof of it in writing. All Jane could do was continue repeating, ""But I didn't retire! I'm not ready to retire!"" while unsuccessfully attempting to get the support of the other employee who refused to come to her defence. Sandy then pointed to the box containing Jane's belongings, wished her a happy retirement, and told her to leave the office. Jane quickly rifled through the box and noticed that the small box containing the index cards with client informaiton was not there. She insisted that Sandy return it to her which Sandy refused to do explaining that it was property of the business, contained personal client information, and that she would be in violation of Canadian privacy laws if she were to let Jane take it. Jane's shock had now turned to obstinance and she refused to leave without the box. Both the other employee and Sandy's boyfriend had started to get involved, repeatedly telling Jane to just leave.

Sandy then informed Jane that if she didn't leave, they would have to call the RCMP (Canadian police), at which point, Sandy's boyfriend dialled 911 to inform the dispatcher of a disgruntled former employee at XYZ Travel Agency who was refusing to leave the premises. Within a few minutes, two police officers arrived, and Jane immediately ran to the door ranting about being fired and about the missing box of client info. In order to deescalate the situation, one police officer told Jane to come outside and explain to him her side of the story. The other officer remained in the office to hear Sandy's side of the story agreeing that Jane was not legally entitled to the box of client info. The other officer then reentered the business and told Jane to wait outside. He said that Jane was insisting that Sandy was holding onto her personal belongings, namely a box of important information. Both Sandy and the officer who had spoken to her explained the contents of the box to the other officer who in turn agreed it was not Jane's property. The police officers then picked up the larger box of Jane's personal belongings, took it outside to Jane, and told her she needed to go home.

To rub salt in Jane's wounds, the next day, Sandy put up a large sign in the window of the business congratulating Jane on her retirement and even put a small announcement in the local newspaper doing the same thing. The icing on the piece of revenge cake was Sandy, when filling out the necessary government forms for when an employee quits / gets fired / retires, made sure to check the box labelled ""retired"" for the reason for Jane no longer being employed. By doing so, Jane was ineligible to collect unemployment insurance benefits."

I don‚Äôt understand why the cost of living in this country is so freaking high. Then we are expected to still pay for all these other kinds of bills and then have our credit ruined because we didn‚Äôt pay them because we were trying just to keep a roof over our head. Literally 100% of my income is rent and I am falling behind on every single other credit card or loan etc which actually amounts to something. Is my only option to become homeless so I can pay off debt??? What a twisted word that we live in. I know everyone is just gonna tell me that it‚Äôs my fault but I already know I‚Äôm a failure.

What's the lore there?  I get that you have to post if you visit some of them, which is a cool idea.  I did a search here and that's about all I came across, which I had already pieced together.

How many are there?  Once I stumbled upon one of them that referenced another, I rabbit-holed until I found those listed, at which point I was very confused and out of my depth.

How did it get started?  Some of them are rather old, but others in the sequence are significantly younger.

Thanks, and sorry if it's not a good question.

Everything was planned, thought out, and well executed. It is very obvious that so much time, effort, blood, sweat, and tears and so much more made it into this novel.

Every character had depth and mystery while still growing and changing. I could not tell you who was my favorite because everyone was so different and they all had their own role to play (Tsukiko and Herr Thiessen are pretty damn cool tho).

I thoroughly enjoyed the non-linear story telling and I was constantly flipping through to double check dates and times of events. Even though it was difficult to keep track of the timelines in my head, it added to the mystery of the novel and made it that much more enchanting.

Last but certainly not least, I love love love the circus itself. Morgenstern put so much into just describing the circus that I got completely lost in it. It made me want to go to Le Cirque des R√™ves myself and experience the magic. (The most memorable tent for me is the Cloud Maze)"

No disrespect to cultures that continue to use the Chopstick but from a user's perspective the fork and knife are clearly superior.

Any tool that can be used to achieve the same goal with an easier learning curve is the superior tool. 

Anyone with User Experience design knowledge will tell you that it's ALWAYS better to achieve the same goal with a more intuitive interface. 

In Western countries, anyone who judges someone else for preferring to use a fork and/or knife to eat ""asian"" cuisine is simply Gatekeeping or being unnecessarily judgemental."

Is it okay to wear a bra for fake breasts as a mtf trans,lgbt,2090,x5oj00,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/x5oj00,243,1662302315.0,"i‚Äôm a trans fem who hasn‚Äôt started hormone therapy yet. i found out about my own identity pretty late in my life as i grew up in a very conservative country, and always just thought i was curious what being a woman feels like whenever i had thoughts like ‚Äúi wish i was a girl, i hate being a guy.‚Äù

and because of my late discovery, my puberty has already been ongoing for quite a long time, im 6‚Äô1 tall, has a fairly deep voice, and masculine facial structure. 

to even have the opportunity to have access to hormone therapy i need to wait two more years before the gender clinic gets the referral from my psychiatrist. and that is so frustrating because i can‚Äôt imagine how much more masculine my body will get.

so for now my only choice is to wear a padded bra everyday to mimic breasts. but i still can‚Äôt help but feel a little bit scared to show them because i‚Äôm scared of judgement. most people at my school still see me as a cis guy, and i feel like they might judge me for ‚Äúputting on fake breasts and being a pervert‚Äù?

it also doesn‚Äôt help that i‚Äôm mainly attracted to women, i want to know that it is normal, i feel like less of a girl, and sometimes even doubt if im really trans or even think maybe i AM just a straight guy who likes to present as a female. (though i‚Äôm recently discovering some attraction to men, but just mainly sexual in nature)

i wish i could just wake up one day and be a perfectly cis woman. i hate my body that i live in."

Changed lanes with signal and all to prepare for an exit. I couldn't see until I was in the new lane that a bike was coming up on me going about 80 (traffic going like 40 at the time). It would have been impossible to see him coming up so fast from my initial position with traffic. He apparently thought I cut him off from lane splitting, so he pulled up alongside me and brandished a pistol on his hip. I slowed way down and he stayed in front of my SUV for a while trying to get next to me again, then sped off after he couldn't get next to me for 15-20 seconds."

I only like being a mom about 30% of the time.
Baby has been very fussy.. and when she's not, she's just SO LOUD.
I've been wanting to run away and have been saying things like ""if only I knew then what I know now"".... 
This motherhood thing is more than I can take the majority of the time. Then comes the mom guilt... I love my daughter so much. I'd die if anything happened to her. I know she's innocent in all this. She doesn't know any better. Ugh.

**Edit for Update:**

‚ô°She is 1 year old

‚ô°I had PPD, been off medicine for ~ 6 mo, just in a rough patch. Could definitely benefit from some therapy, but life is a little crazy right now. (Oh the irony. Lol)

‚ô°I'm a SAHM, would love maybe even a part time job, but it's just not feasible. We live rural and all daycares here have LONG wait lists.

‚ô°Every so often my husband travels for work (90 day jobs) and we go with him, which we are currently doing. Which makes it hard to find a trustworthy sitter in a new place.

‚ô°When we're not out of town, we are 6 hours from family, not exactly conducive to dropping her off on a random weekday. Haha"

The low effort edits, unfunny poetry remakes, unoriginal text posts/theories, people trying to one up Big Blubby at some trivial shit and redundant polls are ruining both subreddits.

And I realize it's because Big Ham has been dry asf lately, there's no content to snark at, which brings me to my actual main point. It seems like Amby's career is dying.

Which is great, because she is an awful person. But it also sucks to visit the subs and be met with content that's equally as boring and cringe as the person we're making fun of.

I know I have gained a very, very, very small but lovely following of people who recognize me on this subreddit. I love all of you and I‚Äôm very proud of you.

I cannot continue identifying weevils at this time because I am returning to college and have pretty limited free time.

I‚Äôll be making fabric patterns and illustrations inspired by the weevils this quarter :) you may see me occasionally, but don‚Äôt expect to see me on every post anymore. 

<3 feel free to carry on my legacy if it brings you joy!!!!!  

To make large text, put a ‚Äú#‚Äù at the beginning of a line. 

#like this. 

It‚Äôs also important to use a lowercase r in r/weeviltime to create the link. This is how new users most easily find us :) 

I always type it as:
‚Äú#ITS r/weeviltime BABEYYYYYYYYY‚Äù

With multiple Y‚Äôs, all caps on ITS and BABEY, and with an unnecessary ‚ÄúE‚Äù in Baby. 

Depending on the context I usually tell the OP that weevils cannot bite or sting, that they eat dried goods from pantries, or I come up with a silly little backstory that ties in with the context for a post. 

I love you all and will return when able <3

I found a perfect studio but it will take up 55% of my take-home after tax income (take home $3,500 rent is $1,950). I‚Äôve lived with roommates all my life and want to now start living alone. Also I have moved 3 times in the last 2 years due to bad and traumatic roommates. It seems that living with other people is just giving me anxiety. I also have a dog who doesn‚Äôt like other people. I want to find a place to live long-term since moving in this market is just costing me more money. I seem to be on a good trajectory at work and might see a raise in 6-8 months. I have no debt and my spending is quite mild (cook at home 90%, take public transport).

Is this a bad idea and I should just suck it up and find a roommate?

Also, with the rental market what is right now, it feels like if I don‚Äôt get a studio now, the rent is just gonna keep increasing more and the studio I want is rent-controlled.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your insights. My first post on reddit and got so much great advice. ü•∫ I rlly appreciate both sides of the argument. I think the best thing to do for me is to find a studio for a bit cheaper."

&#x200B;

**Recruiting after attracting press coverage**

>Members give one another tips about where to place posters and stickers legally, and they urge one another to wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints. But in practice, Patriot Front members frequently target storefronts or places of worship, which is vandalism. Additionally, many colleges and universities, another favorite target for postering, prohibit flyers from nonstudent groups. White supremacists see campuses as a strategic location for flyering: a place to recruit potential members while attracting press coverage to amplify their propaganda.

&#x200B;

**This is a real group, not an FBI sting/honeypot**

>The group did not ""pop outta nowhere"" as Rogan \[has\] suggested. ""Far from being an 'unknown' entity that suspiciously materialized ... in December 2021, both Patriot Front and Rousseau have been the subject of monitoring and news coverage since"" 2017, Snopes reports. Gigabytes of leaked emails and Discord server messages from inside the group also appear to be genuine.

...

>This wouldn't be the first time the American right tried to blame the FBI for the actions of extremists. In January 2022, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) suggested during a Senate hearing that a man named Ray Epps, who participated in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, was actually an FBI informant tasked with inciting the riot.  
>  
>A spokesperson for the Jan. 6 committee later said the committee ""has interviewed Mr. Epps,"" who told them that ""he was not employed by, working with, or acting at the direction of any law enforcement agency on January 5th or 6th or at any other time, and that he has never been an informant for the FBI or any other law enforcement agency.""

([Why right-wingers claim white nationalist group Patriot Front is an FBI sting](https://theweek.com/us/1014893/what-is-patriot-front))

&#x200B;

>The leak of more than 400 gigabytes of messages and other media from two internal Patriot Front forums, made publicly available in January by nonprofit media outlet Unicorn Riot, provides new insight into how the group reacted not only to Rogan‚Äôs segment but to coverage from more traditional outlets. Page after page of conversation lay bare efforts by Front members to aggregate mentions of itself in the mainstream press to craft videos designed to amplify its recruitment on platforms such as Telegram, where neo-Nazi rhetoric is openly espoused.

**Patriot Front is a neo-Nazi, white supremacist, antisemitic, fascist group**

>According to leaked messages, Patriot Front‚Äôs rank and file still enjoy doing ‚ÄòRoman salutes‚Äô despite rules saying they shouldn‚Äôt. In one direct message exchange members nostalgically recalled **throwing up Nazi salutes ‚Äúin front of a PF flag in full uniform‚Äù** at a bar in Europe while meeting up with Polish neo-Nazi skinheads. In one leaked video of masked Patriot Front members reading a manifesto, as they take off their official gear one of them remarks, ‚Äú**Sieg fucking heil!** Lets fucking go.

>Patriot Front is a white supremacist group whose members maintain that their ancestors conquered America and bequeathed it to them, and no one else.

...

>In 2018, less than a year after splintering from the openly antisemitic and neo-Nazi Vanguard America, Patriot Front transitioned from using explicitly antisemitic and traditional white supremacist language in its propaganda to using more ambiguous messaging, including phrases such as ‚ÄúAmerica First,‚Äù ‚ÄúUnited We Stand,‚Äù ‚ÄúBetter Dead Than Red,‚Äù ‚ÄúTwo Parties. One Tyranny,‚Äù ‚ÄúReclaim America‚Äù and ‚ÄúNot Stolen. Conquered.‚Äù They also changed the URL to their website, naming the website after the group, rather than using the right-wing nationalist slogan ‚ÄúBlood and Soil.‚Äù Since mid-2018, Patriot Front has continued to build its ‚Äúbrand,‚Äù carefully avoiding explicit antisemitic and white supremacist language and symbols. Yet, though their outward brand is more ‚Äúsanitized,‚Äù their antisemitism is still present.

...

>Sample of Antisemitism in their Discord chats:  
>  
>‚ÄúMedia pushes anti-white agenda and inciting acts of violence against whites, like in Waukesha and BLM riots. The Jewish control in the media pushes the anti-white narrative.‚Äù 12.1.2021

...

>Leadership disputes aside, the split between Vanguard America and Patriot Front is symptomatic of the divergent opinions among white supremacists about optics and how to best promote their cause to the public. Rousseau‚Äôs camp prefers to promote ‚ÄúAmerican Nationalism‚Äù and advocate for a racist ideology that appeals to conservatives, using ostensibly unifying symbols like the American flag. In that same vein, Patriot Front uses an image of a fasces, **the original symbol of fascism** (a bundle of sticks featuring an axe) encircled by thirteen stars as ‚Äúan American symbol of revolutionary spirit.‚Äù

([ADL: Patriot Front](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/patriot-front))

&#x200B;

>Patriot Front (PF) is a white nationalist hate group that formed in the aftermath of the deadly ‚ÄúUnite the Right‚Äù rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, of August 12, 2017. The organization broke off from Vanguard America (VA), a neo-Nazi group that participated in the chaotic demonstration. PF‚Äôs founder, Thomas Rousseau, led VA members during ‚ÄúUnite the Right,‚Äù including James Alex Fields, Jr., the young man accused of murdering anti-racist protester Heather Heyer after fatally driving his vehicle into a crowd of protesters.

([SPLC: Patriot Front](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/patriot-front))

&#x200B;

>The person who gained entrance to the group said Rousseau was one of three Patriot Front members who interviewed him on the telephone when he applied. He was asked to explain his political evolution, to say which political figures he hated and admired most, to state the circumstances in which the use of violence would be OK and to articulate the greatest threat to America. He was told Mussolini‚Äôs **‚ÄúThe Doctrine of Fascism‚Äù** would be required reading.

&#x200B;

>Potential recruits who fail to mention race during interviews are quickly rejected by the group‚Äôs leaders and pejoratively labeled ‚Äúcivnats,‚Äù a nickname for so-called civic nationalists. In the eyes of Patriot Front recruiters, civic nationalists are those who profess a strong national identity, but are insufficiently hostile to concepts of racial equality or multiculturalism.  
>  
>‚ÄúHas read **Mein Kampf**, **Hitler‚Äôs** Revolution. MK was really interesting. Hitler as a thinker and revolutionary,‚Äù notes read from one interview with a potential recruit, who was ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù in his initial screening.  
>  
>‚ÄúWas struck by the fact that **Hitler** does not sound crazy or like a raving madman,‚Äù another recruit‚Äôs notes read.  
>  
>‚ÄúAdmires Henry Ford because he was based and got a medal from **Hitler**,‚Äù says another.

**The lack of overt violence is branding/strategy, but doesn't mean the group isn't violent**

>Patriot Front was formed in the aftermath of the deadly ‚ÄúUnite the Right‚Äù rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. While many on America‚Äôs far-right cheered the rally, its violence struck others as a public-relations debacle for the white nationalist brand that was sure to attract greater oversight by law enforcement.  
>  
>Patriot Front aspired to help chart a new way forward: spread propaganda espousing its version of a nascent American fascism; quietly recruit new members worried about a nation overrun by immigrants and a world controlled by Jews; avoid talking about guns or violence online, but engage in a mix of vandalism and intimidation to foster anxiety; wear masks in public and communicate secretly.

...

>‚ÄúIt is very common for the leadership of these groups to disqualify violence, while doing things that are encouraging violence,‚Äù Simi said. ‚ÄúIt is part of their strategy to avoid liability, while simultaneously promoting hate. When they say they are not violent, this is a lie. They are promoting violence by their goals.‚Äù

...

>According to the person who infiltrated Patriot Front, Rousseau worries greatly about his members making the worst strategic mistake: carrying out an act of terrible violence.

TIFU by putting a dildo on my forehead and swinging it while it's holding by the suction cup.,tifu,1125,x5qzl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/x5qzl2/tifu_by_putting_a_dildo_on_my_forehead_and/,160,1662308564.0,"First post here but I feel like I really did fucked up.

&#x200B;

I'm a really open woman and I have many sex toys which I love to add to our sex life. Today me and my fianc√© used one of my most realistic dildo for me to suck while he's taken care of something else... Afterward the dildo was only covered in my saliva and dried up pretty quickly so while laying in bed I was playing around with it for fun. That dildo have a really strong suction cup and so I stick it to my palm and was messing around laughing at my ""dildo hand"".

&#x200B;

Then I got this brilliant idea to stick it to my forehead and after a good amount of try it ended up sticking to it really well, so I was laughing and saying :

\-BAEEE Look I'm a unicorn!

&#x200B;

Shaking my head around and I was really impressed that it was not falling even with all the heavy movements.

He even said to me:

\-You're a ""Unitard"" quoting Ralph from the Simpsons while laughing at me (which is fair ü§£).

&#x200B;

I then thought of like hickies and while moving my head I could feel the pressure so I decided to remove it, at this point I had it probably for like a minute max a minute and half.

&#x200B;

I instantly checked the mirror and freaked out! I have a big suction mark maybe 1 inch diameter (which was the center only of the suction cup) in the middle of my forehead. Obviously he's still laughing at me when I'm putting heat on it to try to make it go away as quick as possible.

&#x200B;

I'm a bit freaking out because I work at my office on Tuesday and he seems to believe that there's no way it'll be gone by then. Also our wedding is in 13 days exactly. I'm really freaked out so if anyone have any idea how can I make that go away ASAP or what story can I tell to someone if they notice it at work else then I decided to stick a dildo to my forehead and pretend to be a unicorn ü§™, it would be much appreciated !!!

**TL;DR** : I thought it was funny to pretend to be a unicorn by sticking a dildo on my forehead and now I have a big suction mark (like a big hickey) on my forehead, I work at the office in 2 days and my wedding is in 13 days.

**Edit**: Someone asked a photo so here it is  [https://i.imgur.com/kPtVS1e.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/kPtVS1e.jpg)

**Second edit**: Thanks for your help everyone!‚ù§Ô∏è I'll use green concealer and let my makeup artist know if it still show a few days before the wedding. I've also ordered Arnica ointment and for now I'm using cold on it instead of heat. I'll update in a few days and maybe after the wedding :)"

I'm 5'3 and I started my recovery journey at 195 pounds. Seeing that number was a big wake up call especially for my height. It's too much. I needed to get better from my eating disorder. I didn't go into this with the immediate idea of weight loss. I knew that would be my detriment. I focused mostly on fixing my relationship with food and learning what actual hunger cues are. I'm still learning all of that, but I'm feeling better mentally and I'm starting to see a difference physically!

I took the recent picture yesterday and felt kind of sad looking at it. I didn't see a big difference until I put the before picture next to it. I remember feeling defeated staring at my newest picture and like I haven't done enough. But I have. I've lost 26 pounds! I'm officially at 169 pounds! I know bmi isn't the end all be all, but it's a good start for me to occasionally check on. I'm no longer ""obese"" and just ""overweight."" I'm actually proud of myself. I did this in a positive way and my relationship with food and my body has never been more positive. I feel like crying just typing this.

My wife got demoted. What should she do?,jobs,649,x5ojc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x5ojc3/my_wife_got_demoted_what_should_she_do/,875,1662302343.0,"My wife works in the human resources department at a university. Our family health insurance is through her job since I am self employed. About a month ago, her manager had to call her into his office since IT had noticed she had checked some co-workers‚Äô salaries using her computer which she was not authorized to do. Out of nervousness she initially denied it, but then the next day, thanks to the excellent advice of many people here in r/jobs, she came clean and got to keep her job. The manager thanked her for coming forward and for saving him the time of having to further investigate. That post is here- https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/wf3eje/can_my_wife_get_fired_for_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Last week, however, a woman who my wife works with was promoted, and the manager told my wife that she now needs to take on all of the co-worker‚Äôs old duties and, in addition, that she needs to continue being responsible for the work that my wife has been doing up until now. 

In addition to that, he told my wife that she can no longer have two remote days per week, but can only have one. The other ten or so employees in her department all get two remote days, and this was one of the reasons my wife wanted the job in the first place. The ability to work remote that extra day is very helpful for her rest (since she can get up later because of not needing to drive to work) and her ability to be able to make sure my daughter gets to school. My daughter has ongoing medical treatment so changes in our lifestyle like this, which add stress, can potentially have a significant impact.

The third change her manager made was to require her to come to work a half hour earlier each day which also of-course affects her ability to get rest (her overall work hours are the same since she can leave a half hour earlier, but she‚Äôd prefer to come later). Finally, he moved her working space to a less desirable area in the corner.

Should she have a discussion with her manager about this? If so, how can she do it tactfully and what should she say? Could this be punishment for the checking other peoples‚Äô salaries incident? I don‚Äôt want her to sound ungrateful for being able to keep her job, but also don‚Äôt want her to be subjected to something she doesn‚Äôt have to be. Can she ask him, for example, if this is all temporary? Can she ask for a raise in light of this? Should she even agree to all this?

Thanks!"

Like people do realize the story needs a villain right?

HHH/Herbert‚Äôs Hundred Harem

&#x200B;

‚ÄúYes, I realize that what happened wasn‚Äôt a hundred percent to character ma‚Äôam. But let‚Äôs be honest, you wouldn‚Äôt want it to be. Do remember the characters you want me to act as are criminals, thieves at the least, murderers mostly and some with truly sadistic methodologies. True, Riddler wouldn‚Äôt just give things away and Deathstroke would only fight for proper pay or some further goal. But this is about entertainment and style, not about actually having super-criminals in the city.‚Äù Herbert says into his communicator.

The mayor had called to call him out on how inaccurate his portrayal of The Riddler and Deathstroke was. He was both impressed with how much of a nerd the woman had become and thoroughly unimpressed with how poorly she thought this through.

‚ÄúI mean, if you want me to hold the city to ransom I can but I‚Äôll get my ass court marshalled so fast that the game will be called on account of military intervention.‚Äù He continues as he laughs in amusement.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not funny! There‚Äôs a serious uptake in tourism and interest in our colony and I don‚Äôt want to lose it! We need to take advantage of a situation as its occurring!‚Äù She protests and Herbert sighs because she‚Äôs right, but it‚Äôs so much more complicated than that.

‚ÄúI understand that, I appreciate that you‚Äôre trying to balance the budget of an entire city whose main export seems to be thrilling chases and fights. In that light it‚Äôs only natural to go into vigilante style street performances! Keeps people in the city, gets a lot of people employed and there is an undeniable charm to what‚Äôs happening. However, we have to do this sanely otherwise there‚Äôs also going to be an uptick in the mortuary business!‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs going to be a fair number of people losing a critical portion of their family income if this doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù The Mayor replies and Herbert rolls his eyes at that but since this is audio only it doesn‚Äôt insult the bureaucrat.

‚ÄúWhich is why we need to find a balance, a way for not only the colony to prosper in its entirety but to keep people safe while this happens.‚Äù Herbert tells her and she takes a few deep breaths. ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve calmed down do you want to hear my idea? A little something so that both tourists and citizens can get involved with a minimization of deaths and injuries and we can still get a TON of action and therefore entertainment out of it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm listening.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been working on developing a levelling system with the men back on The Dauntless. Long story short we have people register to be part of these and for the levels we have a basic test of competency. First level would be basic reading and writing skills and to be in good enough health that you‚Äôre not about to fall down dead due to a stiff breeze. In those cases it‚Äôs just a big goofy play fight that you could get a toddler involved in without much issue.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not going to bring in tourists!‚Äù She protests.

‚ÄúNo, but it WILL serve as a level that the truly incompetent and not combat ready can be at so they don‚Äôt charge into the middle of a pitched fight, get themselves killed and have their grieving relatives sue the city for the death.‚Äù Herbert replies and she stops.

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre implying that at every level there‚Äôs a waiver so that people cannot sue the city for their voluntary involvement in what‚Äôs essentially a gladiatorial fight?‚Äù She asks.

‚ÄúExactly. Second level will require those involved to not only have some form of armour and appropriate weaponry but demonstrate at least basic competence in their use. Couple that with a few logic puzzles and such and we can keep people like that entertained all day while they run around the city and take occasional breaks in the venues. Couple that with some classes that can be offered to help build the armour and gear and stores that sell the components or completed gear and we have more revenue for the city.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat would get the vast majority of the galaxy feeling like they can take part without being matronized at. This could open us up to a great deal of non-Apex races.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt would indeed, however third and fourth level would be more where the Apex are likely to be at. At third level there is actual risk of injury and non-lethal but still powerful weapons regularly used. They‚Äôll need not only effective armour and weapons, but at least a professional understanding of combat and the ability to fight at such a level in the armour and with the weapons. Fourth level is basically third level with an additional stack of waivers because once we‚Äôre there we‚Äôre out for blood. Not death though, we won‚Äôt straight up murder our enemies, but we‚Äôre going to break bones and shed blood.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what about those that don‚Äôt want to fight but instead want to think? One of the major appeals of the character is that he‚Äôs incredible intelligent and pragmatic.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat can be worked into a separate system. In fact if that one is handled by a specialized party on your part with some crossovers, our villains playing as Boss Battles or rewards or something of the sort then that would work out wonderfully. Hire a Gravia for a logic puzzle, maybe a Gohb or a Kohb for something mechanical or medical and you‚Äôll have a fairly high bar of competence.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that trite human term? That‚Äôs Racist?‚Äù She asks and Herbert snorts.

‚ÄúStereotypes come from somewhere ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight... Look I apologize for being... pushy with things, but the city does need this. The budgetary meetings for this colony are living horror shows and that we‚Äôve been able to increase the city‚Äôs lifeline by a trickle due to all this human silliness is a small miracle by itself. Many of our guests are extremely tough, self-reliant and leave in a hurry. Fine traits for the efficiency, but hell on the economy when that‚Äôs the main source of revenue, these... hero and villain games have already attracted steady stream of interest from the galaxy at large and we‚Äôve had a much more reasonable looking budget meeting.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd imagine it would have looked more reasonable if you hadn‚Äôt had to rework the city.‚Äù Herbert notes and there‚Äôs actually a smug sounding laugh from the other side. ‚ÄúLet me guess, the residents wanted to do that on their own and part of the profits were the permits to do so?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù She answers and he chuckles.

‚ÄúGood, very good. Now are there any other concerns ma‚Äôam? There‚Äôs a lot to do to get this all moving properly and a fair amount is out of my hands. I‚Äôm pretty much just a message runner at this point. Unless you want attack of the teenage Deathstroke to happen again?‚Äù He asks.

‚ÄúPerhaps not, but I would like a rough timetable if you have one.‚Äù

‚ÄúWithin the week. There are a lot of men on The Dauntless which think the idea of using this place as a recruiting point and more than a few are EAGER to play along. We‚Äôve already got our Bane analogue opened up in a man who‚Äôs rapidly growing to Cannidor scale and is of the same nationality and culture as the actual villain in the comic books. He‚Äôs even making his own custom luchador mask.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd other villains?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to be shifts to be honest. We don‚Äôt want anyone losing themselves in character and go from portraying a supervillain to actually being a supervillain.‚Äù Herbert remarks and there‚Äôs a pause on the other side.

‚ÄúYes, that would be a problem wouldn‚Äôt it? How prone are humans to such things?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt depends entirely on the pressures the individual in question has been through. Certain people are extremely prone, others are not prone in the slightest. But the risk is still significant enough that we‚Äôre going to be minimizing it with some simple but practical safety measures.‚Äù Herbert replies. ‚ÄúOne of which is significant time outside of costume, which is why we‚Äôre going to need a public announcement or a city bylaw about not harassing them when they‚Äôre just looking to unwind.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in this game long enough to know when I‚Äôm being sweetened up for something. You‚Äôre doing it in a weird way, but you‚Äôre still doing it. What do you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúApproval to set up two separate locations for The Undaunted. One on the ground, the other as an airship of our own. This will allow us to recruit and accommodate both our needs and that of the colony and...‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù She cuts off his pitch and leaves him hanging. He gives a little huff of amusement.

‚ÄúThank you ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

‚ÄúWere you expecting me to argue?‚Äù She asks in an amused tone.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve dealt with a lot of the really stubborn and... hard to persuade types let‚Äôs call them.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre allowed to say stupid.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to be diplomatic.‚Äù Herbert responds and she snorts. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so funny?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust the fact that I have a child around your age so I can tell when a teenager is forcing their voice lower to sound more mature.‚Äù She remarks. ‚ÄúDo you think he‚Äôd make a good Robin?‚Äù

‚ÄúSight unseen without knowing anything beyond gender? I have no god-damn idea. Send him to my fellow Undaunted for an evaluation and we‚Äôll see, send him for training and we‚Äôll put him on the level of Robin.‚Äù Herbert replies and she chuckles.

‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll wait until one of your men contacts me specifically... and I now have a call waiting.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy employers tend to do such things. If it‚Äôs Sir Philip please tell him hello from me.‚Äù Herbert says.

‚ÄúAlright hang on a moment.‚Äù She says and Herbert finishes up with the weapon maintenance he‚Äôd been doing to keep his hands busy during the call. The laser rifle worked better when all the lenses were utterly pristine, you could get just a hair‚Äôs breadth more power out of the same amount of energy. A few extra degrees Kelvin may not sound like much, but if it‚Äôs the difference between a melting point and not then it can really get through some armour. Yes the power could be ramped up, but the difference between potentially damaging the weapon or not also has to be considered.

The call opens back up again.

‚ÄúSo... Sir Philip...‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs basically if Alfred was Batman for Bruce‚Äôs sake isn‚Äôt he?‚Äù She asks and Herbert bursts out into cackles.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never heard it put quite THAT way before, but I suppose. The man is a legend that‚Äôs still alive. Much of the books and films based off his life had to be toned down to keep them realistic.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn Cruel Space?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, he‚Äôs been out of Cruel Space as long as I have. His published biography is in both the fiction and non-fiction categories in bookstores. Hell of a read. Terrifying too, to know just how close some lunatics came to wiping out hundreds of thousands of people.‚Äù Herbert remarks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve slowly been peeling details out of him and it‚Äôs all lining up so far.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think he could be stationed here?‚Äù The Mayor asks.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not only old, but has no desire for rejuvenation treatments and is heading back to earth before the year ends. He has an estate there, Grandchildren and Great-Grandchildren and fully believes that he‚Äôs given enough over his long life of hard service to Queen and Country. This last one is for Humanity though so he was willing to come out or retirement for one last ride.‚Äù Herbert repeats what Sir Philip has told him many times.

He‚Äôs not bringing up the active betting pool or his own wager on it that the man has been possibly using a slow acting rejuvenation to grow younger internally first and then head back to earth to get his family and then take them out to a planet he‚Äôs going to simply conquer and call Newest England. Or the fact that Sir Philip had more or less instantly found the pool and placed a sizable bet on himself being honest.

That had led to a second betting pool on whether or not he was fucking with them, being honest or both simultaneously. The leading bet was both and Herbert decidedly backed out before he made his direct superior and teacher upset with him.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fairly sad to know that someone like that is content to just fade away.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs given so much that death has nothing to scare him with anymore. To him it just looks like peace and after the life he‚Äôs lived, peace sounds wonderful.‚Äù Herbert remarks.

‚ÄúPoor man.‚Äù The Mayor remarks.

‚ÄúPoor nothing, he‚Äôs a great man who‚Äôs forged a legacy that will last far beyond him. His life has been full and long and there is nothing to pity about it.‚Äù Herbert replies. ‚ÄúSure, he‚Äôs not even hit a century, but he‚Äôs filled that time with more than most will do in a thousand years.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan we get on a less depressing topic please?‚Äù She asks and cannot see the enormous smile on Herbert‚Äôs face.

‚ÄúCertainly, I believe I mentioned mortuaries earlier didn‚Äôt I?‚Äù He asks.

‚ÄúOh my goodness! You are little cretin.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the restorative Coma that did that. I‚Äôm going to end up slightly taller than average for my species.‚Äù Herbert says impishly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it did nothing for your sense of humour, some things are just beyond saving.‚Äù

‚ÄúFair enough. Now are there any more specific concerns about the Undaunted approaching or...?‚Äù

‚ÄúWill they be contacting my office for permits on building their recruiting centers?‚Äù She asks.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Herbert answers.

‚ÄúThen no.‚Äù She says and hangs up.

‚ÄúI think I got to her.‚Äù He notes with a grin.

He mentioned the trip to the barber, who responded,

 ‚ÄúWhy would anyone want to go there? It‚Äôs crowded and dirty and full of Italians. You‚Äôre crazy to go to Rome. So, how are you getting there?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre taking United,‚Äù was the reply. ‚ÄúWe got a great rate!‚Äù

‚ÄúUnited!‚Äù exclaimed the barber. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a terrible airline. Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly and they‚Äôre always late. So, where are you staying in Rome?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be at the downtown International Marriott.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat dump! That‚Äôs the worst hotel in Rome. The rooms are small, the service is surly and they‚Äôre overpriced. So, whatcha doing when you get there?‚Äù

""We‚Äôre going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope.""

""That‚Äôs rich,‚Äù laughed the barber. ‚ÄúYou and a million other people trying to see him. He‚Äôll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You‚Äôre going to need it!‚Äù

A month later, Dave again came in for his regular haircut. The barber asked him about his trip to Rome.

‚ÄúIt was wonderful,‚Äù explained Dave. ‚ÄúNot only were we on time in one of United‚Äôs brand new planes, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a beautiful young stewardess who waited on me hand and foot. And the hotel! Well, it was great! They‚Äôd just finished a $25 million remodeling job and now it‚Äôs the finest hotel in the city. They were overbooked too, so they apologized and gave us the presidential suite at no extra charge!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù muttered the barber. ‚ÄúI know you didn‚Äôt get to see the Pope.‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, we were quite lucky, for as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the Pope likes to meet some of the visitors, and if I‚Äôd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the Pope would personally greet me. Sure enough, five minutes later, the Pope walked in. As I knelt down he spoke to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did he say?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòWhere‚Äôd you get this shitty haircut?"""

First, they used violence and our own vulnerability during pregnancy and early motherhood to TAKE rights from us. If patriarchy was the natural order, it wouldn't have to be enforced so strongly with oppressive laws and culture. 

And each right won back by women was done by women organising and protesting in ways that made life uncomfortable for men, to the point where lifting that form of oppression was more convenient than continuing to enforce it.

Same with civil rights for minorities. White people didn't GIVE black people civil rights - they took away rights by force until enforcing the oppression was costing them too much to continue.

And as with abortion rights, we've seen that as soon as they perceived they had the power to enforce the oppression again, they did. 

Men do not GIVE women rights out of the goodness of their hearts, as if they are naturally entitled to more rights then women, but are benevolent enough to grant us certain ones that are above our natural station. 

The ""men gave women the right to _______ "" narrative supports patriarchy by putting the control over women's rights into the hands of men."

From what i've seen on social media Solo is generally considered an average movie and i couldn't disagree more. I absolutely loved the two heist scenes, Donald Glover and the Zombieland guy delivered amazing performances, Dryden and  Qi'ra were great villains and the scene in the Maelstrom looked absolutely stunning. Another thing i loved were the glimpses of the life of an average person under the Empire's rule. The plot was overall quite predictable but i still enjoyed every moment of it. Two nitpicks i have is that Han's DL-44 was just given to him by Zombieland guy, i feel like it should have been more important, for me it's very iconic and L3's behavior implies that all droids are sentient which i find kind of strange. Overall an amazing movie in my opinion It's criminal there isn't a sequel yet."

A person on the opposite seat offered their seat to an older gentleman to sit, which is always lovely to see. However as they got up, they pointed to the sign above my partner's head and said ""Well that one's the priority seat anyway"" with a very accusationary tone and glared at my partner.

My partner has M.E. and cannot stand for long periods of time. It results in severe joint pain, and if she gets too exhausted, can leave her bedbound the next day. She's working with various medical professionals to try and improve things but it does mean she sometimes does need to sit down and preserve her energy. This doesn't result in any physical signs of disability, but it's definitely there.

Obviously this really upset my partner. I immediately piped up and went ""Yes, and she's disabled"", and this person goes ""Oh, my mistake"". Yes, yes it was. Please don't immediately judge someone just because they don't ""look disabled"". TfL have the badges you can get, and we've now applied for one, but just because someone isn't wearing a badge doesn't mean they don't need the seat. Also if you do make this mistake, at least have the balls to use the word ""Sorry"".

&#x200B;

Edit: Had a few ask. I didn't give up my seat as I didn't have a seat to give up! I was stood next to the seat my partner was in"

What a crazy weekend.

Didn't think after all the chaos and adventure we had at the end of July (and all of August), we'd be seeing posts asking for **more** proof that the DTCC committed international securities fraud but I guess there's never any harm in collecting as much concrete evidence as possible to present the facts - and thanks to the collaborative efforts of internet sleuths everywhere, we are able to accomplish just that.

That said, be sure not to be distracted from other important conversations like [the upcoming EU vote on the CSDR rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wz2n2k/why_you_should_care_about_the_upcoming_eu_vote_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) or [SEC is allowing the OCC unlimited access to money in pension funds and insurance companies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x56h7d/the_fox_is_guarding_the_hen_house_the_sec_is/) \- but let's get back to addressing the elephant in the room.

In [earlier posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x47lgr/its_been_nearly_a_month_since_a_letter_entitled/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) I explored some potential reasons for the on-going media blackout but realise that I haven't really talked about **WHY** is it important that the mainstream media needs to report that the **DTCC committed international securities fraud** and seemingly, why the story getting out could spell trouble for the SHFs whilst protecting the general public.

# BACK TO BASICS

**So who are the DTCC / DTC, and what do they do:**

* The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is¬†a financial services company that provides clearing and settlement services for the financial markets and settles most securities transactions in the U.S. DTCC's subsidiary.
* The Depository Trust Company (DTC) provides securities movements for NSCC's net settlements, and settlement for institutional trades (which typically involve money and securities transfers).

Basically this means that the DTC, an extended division of the DTCC corporate umbrella, have a contractual obligation (as custodians of the shares on the NYSE) to manage securities in a way that meet the expectations and demands of the companies, like GameStop.

And here's a recap of how I understand our current situation to be:

1. ‚Å†Gamestop is the victim of **naked** shorting by hedge funds, meaning more shares exist than should be legally possible.
2. ‚Å†Gamestop declares a four-for-one split of the Company‚Äôs Class A common stock in the form of a [stock dividend](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-four-one-stock-split)
3. ‚Å†There exist more shares than available dividends meaning the DTC need to make up for this somewhere or reveal the fact there they are short.
4. ‚Å†Everyone gets their shares / everyone is suspicious.
5. ‚Å†Various brokerages across Europe inform apes that they were told to issue the dividend as a stock split.
6. ‚Å†We were provided a form that shows the [wrong code](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wh5tg0/the_dtcc_filed_this_form_using_code_fc02_which_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) was used, and a follow up post to confirm this was indeed the [wrong code](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/whup7y/clearing_up_the_recent_misinformation_about_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [again, more damming evidence of the wrongful processing procedures used.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x5eshu/everyone_keeps_asking_for_proof_of_the_fraud_by/)

As such, we are beginning to understand now that the DTC were unable to facilitate the distribution of the dividend as instructed by GameStop, and thus went against the companies wishes by telling brokerages to issue any outstanding shares as a stock split. **This was fraudulent.**

# So why is this a big deal?

Because there is no reason there should have been an issue with allocating the dividend shares, as were provided by Gamestop, to the shareholders - that is, unless the company had been victim of **naked shorting which is the** [**illegal**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp#:~:text=Naked%20shorting%20is%20the%20illegal,before%20they%20sell%20it%20short) **practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist** \- so why process this as a stock-split, and not a dividend?

Not to mention, these are some of the issues that have happened as a result of this:

1. People didn't receive their shares when promised.
2. People had their shares removed from their accounts after the dividend-split *(I'll refer you to the German saga that took place here around the start of August).*
3. People had GME short positions opened in their \*cash\* accounts as a result of the split *(this was a* [*wild one*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wb54hz/ibkr_have_admitted_to_opening_a_short_position_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)*).*

And who knows if there are tax-related implications that could also follow?

So given that this is something of 'red flag' already, it strikes me as odd that if those as accused had the evidence to prove their innocence or correct us on this matter - wouldn‚Äôt they have absolutely done that already? I mean, I would imagine **any** opportunity to expose this corner of the internet as the true 'cOnSpIrAcY' theorists they claim we are would be something they would bite off your hand to do.

But alas, they haven't.

And judging by the growing assembled evidence, it's because they can't.

...............................

So going on the assumption that everything we have collated together here is indeed, **correct**, let's have a look at some of the possible reasons for the on-going, and painfully deafening, radio silence:

*\*\*and for a more in-depth coverage, there is countless great DD out there in which explore all these topics in exquisite detail.*

# THEY DON'T WANT INVESTORS TO WITHDRAW THEIR FUNDS FROM THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE.

Seems an obvious point to make but roll with me on this one.

I'm only going to gloss over these points as there are far more proficient write ups out there on this subject and I would be doing them an injustice by trying to replicate it here but it seems to me that if investors get spooked and remove their money from the NYSE, well - that might just spell out trouble for anyone over-leveraged out there and any value in the collateral they hold, especially if they hold a number of open naked short positions.

I mean if this was the case, and SHFs were in fact frightened that investors might withdraw their money from under their domain, they would probably do something about it, right?

Like, say **Citadel setting new withdrawal terms for clients?**

https://preview.redd.it/3aghm2fpttl91.jpg?width=686&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6cbdf4c1cd4d31eb1e27bf2f5727337a9f2e46a6

\[[source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/rabfs7/citadel_set_new_withdrawal_terms_for_clients_wut/) / [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/raeuih/citadel_limited_investors_withdrawing_in_08_also/)\]

According to a number of these sources, looks like Kenneth Griffin (Founder, chief executive officer, co-chief investment officer, and 80% owner of Citadel LLC) restricted clients from withdrawing investments last year (approx. 9 months ago) with these amended terms and conditions.

Just for context, see how this compares to the previous T&Cs

&#x200B;

[Fees to put money in, fees for them to manage it, and fees to withdraw it. Citadel never miss an opportunity to make money.](https://preview.redd.it/uufajjz5utl91.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f96c6fd7592f139d2caaf3d5cf6ab065dd22acdb)

\[[source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/raljjj/youve_seen_the_posts_about_citadel_updating_their/)\]

And it seems that history has a way of repeating itself, because would you believe it - it's not the first time they've done this!

Anyone else remember the crash in 2008? Seems Citadel Securities restricted investor withdrawals back then, too!

https://preview.redd.it/jo6noz5tvtl91.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9eb5b2d6cd1116b10742ad999659b32924bb5a3

\[[source](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/funds/hedge-funds-the-road-back-10468466)\] / \[[source](https://www.reuters.com/article/citadelinvestment-idUSN1614248720090916)\]

Anyone else noticing a pattern here?

[Seems history really does repeat itself.](https://preview.redd.it/yd9pv14zvvl91.png?width=1764&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fb3b4ead2e72609576766cebf9b6d3c023e1cbe)

\[[source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nz7qzl/ken_griffin_talks_about_how_they_survived_2008/)\]

But rest easy, seems that some people are getting the memo as according to this post, **Citadel Securities has had investor withdrawals of $470,000,000 as of February 25th, 2022 per self-reported 2021 financial statement:**

https://preview.redd.it/5agv2u2wutl91.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c7c2475031f704ad31f4404450fe30de9cc6a5c7

So assuming that if there are any short hedge funds still in trouble out there, which is surprising as many financial bodies have gone to *excessive* lengths to reassure the public they have closed their short positions (and it's not as if any of them have *ever* lied before [**https://www.kengriffinlies.com/**](https://www.kengriffinlies.com/)) they may not be wanting to lose any further access to investor funds.

Especially considering that Kenneth Griffin had to borrow a whooping [$600 million dollars](https://www.ft.com/content/f3206b39-0cd9-4956-8a87-f5b2f85025ea) earlier this month. Ouch.

Objectively speaking, it could be interpreted that Citadel might be in a bit of a financial pickle here - and should news of the **DTCC Committing International Securities Fraud** get out, I could only imagine this would make things worse.

Not to mention, it's not just the US share holders we're talking about here but a load of international investors withdrawing all their funds would probably have quite the impact on the value of the dollar (and can't imagine the FED would be a fan of that considering they are already flooding the US with an [infinitive supply of funds](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vywx2r/phone_number_price_target_confirmed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) at the federal reserves, which might have something to do with the increasing inflation rates).

https://preview.redd.it/pataww47ytl91.jpg?width=1208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be37b9dc3e7b135aa05a18c798ef7e66450cfcd2

And speaking of international investors - according to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/w0nhl8/did_anyone_catch_that_citadel_advisors_llc_became/) \- **Citadel Advisors LLC became Citadel L P in March of this year, and their SEC filing shows that 44% of their clients are non-United States persons, and most of the money under management (72%) belongs to non-U.S. persons.**

Woah.

Seems Citadel really need these international investors.

Now just imagine the MSM actually did take to reporting the news and informed the general public, based on the evidence we have collected here, that the **DTCC committed international securities fraud** and then everyone removed their shares from the NYSE platform.

Well... I wonder what that would do to all value of the stocks listed as assets on all those SHFs books once people started to withdraw their investments? Bye bye collateral. Bye bye liquidity.

Not to mention what it would do for the integrity of the New York Stock Exchange. Wouldn't that speed up the crash that Burry keeps going on about?

https://preview.redd.it/6bfrq1hkktl91.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7338140756fd9d6c5ac28309f6a8e4f5d7770c82

And god forbid, SHFs suddenly find themselves margin called because they no longer have enough collateral to off-set all their bad bets because their clients are withdrawing their money and selling their stocks on mass.

https://preview.redd.it/2tltra0jktl91.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e5de250ee839c8aa4da118bc971f03f9b67cc03

Well, that's just one theory.

..............

And very briefly focusing on matters a little closer to home, it seems that in a bid to get access to more money - there's now developing some considerable cause for concern when it comes to the safety of **teachers pension pots.**

I really wish I was kidding.

Even now, there's been a fair bit of conversation surrounding **the SEC allowing the OCC unlimited access to money in pension funds, insurance companies, and other institutional investors.** \[[source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x56h7d/the_fox_is_guarding_the_hen_house_the_sec_is/)\] and I see you recoiling in horror when thinking about how innocent, under funded and hard working school teachers, of all people, might find themselves suddenly caught in the cross-fire but I'm afraid - it's not easy reading from here on.

Well, some have speculated that: **Ken Griffin plans to use teacher pensions to go long on REX (GameStop single stock short ETF) which he will then naked short REX in to oblivion as a counter measure to the MOASS** ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x2vmif/ken_griffin_plans_to_use_teacher_pensions_to_go/)) ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vygz4z/are_you_infuriated_at_the_incoming_singlestock/))

[Investor protection, what's that?](https://preview.redd.it/qrrjzozkpul91.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf3e6ded3c716fac95b5fad53acedacface9f3c3)

And it's not as if it's the first time a hedge fund has lost money from pensions. check out **Allianz, in Germany, who lost 7 billion from Arkansas Teachers pension \[**[source](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/germanys-allianz-its-us-funds-troubles-2022-05-17/)\]

Here's hoping SHFs won't be borrowing any money they can't pay back.

Especially since there appears to be a less than harmonious relationship there already. Here's Kenneth Griffin (2021), **directly blaming teachers unions for our economic issues: \[**[source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/uulhve/ken_griffin_is_so_concerned_that_apes_looted/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\]

And some research I found into some of his recent investments:

[Financed anti-teacher campaigns AND wanted to break the Chicago Teachers Union too? ](https://preview.redd.it/itb750h2oul91.png?width=1180&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a4746ae10849faf311ce1e8544f935cd9e64b29)

\[[source](https://news.littlesis.org/2019/10/18/striking-chicago-teachers-are-taking-on-the-billionaire-class-that-is-robbing-students-neighborhoods/)\]

Seems to me that MSM need to be doing more to **warn and protect** those might be at risk and why there are such issues surrounding the mis-managements of funds and securities on Wall Street - especially when this affects a lot more than *just* the retail investors out there.

**And regardless of whatever stories they paint about us after MOASS, you can see here that we have been trying to spread the word so we can HELP people.**

...................................................

So what do we do about it?

[Let your voice be heard.](https://preview.redd.it/d2rp7390dul91.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a81a71693a05ec4294e4976dbbd16e2d2ffc7c6)

Well since the corporate-owned media institutions, or even the publicly funded ones like the BBC, are seemingly unwilling to report this to the public **(that does not get them off the hook)**, it seems we need to throw the net a little wider and reach out to independent journalists.

The ones that inspire us constantly with their integrity, tireless determination and provide us with the ground-breaking stories that change the world (like the whistleblowers featured in the incredible film [Spotlight](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1895587/)).

I feel collectively we have a responsibility as the bearers of this knowledge to warn others that their livelihood and investments are potentially at risk. Especially, seemingly, since others are unwilling to do so.

So I‚Äôm going to share again a **UNIVERSAL TEMPLATE** that anyone could send to those you think may be willing to listen.

^(P.S removed the reference to the code as this was still causing a bit of confusion but if we want this put back in, I can do that too. Still plenty of evidence without it.)

**>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>**

**Dear Sir/Madam,**

**I have evidence to believe that the DTCC has committed securities fraud on the ticker GME (GameStop) which is diluting the value of shares held by institutional and retail investors around the globe.**

**Here is a very short article on Medium:** [https://medium.com/@cuitlahuacpinedayouniss/has-the-dtc-failed-to-deliver-gamestops-dividends-25860d01d1f8](https://medium.com/@cuitlahuacpinedayouniss/has-the-dtc-failed-to-deliver-gamestops-dividends-25860d01d1f8) **which aims to not only provide context as a basis for this letter - but shows there exists extensive evidence demonstrating that many brokerages around the world were informed by the DTC, who are the custodians of these securities, to issue shares on behalf of GameStop in a manner that was fraudulent and against the wishes of the company.**

**The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is a financial services company that provides clearing and settlement services for the financial markets and settles most securities transactions in the U.S. DTCC's subsidiary, The Depository Trust Company (DTC) provides securities movements for NSCC's net settlements, and settlement for institutional trades (which typically involve money and securities transfers).**

**Being such an essential functioning key participator within the American Financial Markets, it struck me as odd that instead of filing the correct form needed to carry out the split-dividend as was issued by the company (a statement as provided by GameStop to clarify the nature of the request as was issued 05/08/22:** [https://news.gamestop.com/stock-split/?n](https://news.gamestop.com/stock-split/?n)**) the** **DTC told brokerages in the US, and internationally, to split the GME shares into four, rather than issue dividend shares as per the corporate action described in GameStop's 8-K filing.**

**Here in this form, you can also see the process type was listed as 'stock split' and not dividend, as was instructed:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wf9mos/dtcc\_form\_for\_gme\_splividend\_from\_dnb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wf9mos/dtcc_form_for_gme_splividend_from_dnb/)

**It should also be noted that this** **should have been performed under the DVSE ISO code but, again, wasn't. Further discussion and evidence to support these claims can be found here:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x5eshu/everyone\_keeps\_asking\_for\_proof\_of\_the\_fraud\_by/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x5eshu/everyone_keeps_asking_for_proof_of_the_fraud_by/)

**The DTC instruction also specified ISO-15022 code SPLF (Forward Split) rather than DVSE (Stock Dividend) so cannot be excused an US Imperial/Metric cause of mistake. See:** [https://www.iso20022.org/15022/uhb/mt564-5-field-22f.htm](https://www.iso20022.org/15022/uhb/mt564-5-field-22f.htm)

**And here is the Securities Fraud law broken by the DTCC. Securities and Commodities Fraud 18 U.S. Code Statute 1348:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x5sgk2/here\_is\_the\_securities\_fraud\_law\_broken\_by\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x5sgk2/here_is_the_securities_fraud_law_broken_by_the/)

**So this begs the question: Why can‚Äôt the DTC deliver the product they are custodians of?**

**Canada's own CDS (The Canadian Depository for Securities Limited) has stated that the DTC advised them to split the shares rather than distribute new dividend shares. The GameStop 8-K filing, dated July 6, 2022 states that the 4-1 split is to be issued ""in the form of a stock dividend."" Reference:** [https://news.gamestop.com/node/19826/html](https://news.gamestop.com/node/19826/html)

**In Germany the same thing is occurring and the Bafin (essentially the securities exchange police), have confirmed that GameStop dividend shares are incorrectly booked in Germany. Reference:** [https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Meldung/2022/meldung\_2022\_08\_02\_gamestop.html;jsessionid=6718D126425080BD1AD3C6C26C55F6A3.1\_cid502](https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Meldung/2022/meldung_2022_08_02_gamestop.html;jsessionid=6718D126425080BD1AD3C6C26C55F6A3.1_cid502)

**The same reports are emerging at a concerning rate from as far reaching as Korea, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Cyprus and many other countries around the globe.**

**Reports out of Korea are stating that their International Equities Team along with their Depository Leader and Counselor will be making a statement on this situation shortly. This is all further evidence that naked shares (otherwise known as synthetic shares or counterfeit shares) have been issued en masse to retail investors around the globe. For your reference, Naked shorting is** **the illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist****.**

**This should be front page on every newspaper around the world and now that this information is in your capable hands, I trust you will do all that you can in your endeavours to investigate this further for the sake of ensuring that the public are well informed and protected in light of potentially criminal activities.**

**Thank you,**

Edit: after some comments I should clarify. Someone that has shot your boat and is defending that hole or keeping your boat up a little longer to steal supplies is not spawn camping."

The store used to say Ukraine but now it says Poland so I'm assuming they are safe at the moment.

It uses few colors but most of them are blended, so we get much more colors and a very cool effect. This was a very fun pattern to work on i learned a lot"

Apparently, in the last couple weeks a ton of soldiers have been getting violently ill, and higher ups realized that almost all of them either live or work near this one particular DFAC. The BC of the unit right there wanted to get ahead of it being an IG thing and wanted to get to the bottoms of it right away (imagine that, a leader actually taking responsibility for the well being of his guys).

Anyway, he ends up sending an E8 on his staff to investigate. He scours the place and realizes that the outbreak coincided with a new Sodexo manager taking over the facility. This guy happens to be Chinese and had implemented a new menu rotation with a lot of Chinese food, noodles and whatnot, so the guy doing the investigation thought that might have something to do with it. But nothing in the ingredients, storage, preparation, any of that stuff he observed seemed off. That is until he saw them putting new plates out to the serving line. They were visibly filthy. Apparently he goes full ass chewing on the manager, grilling him about why he‚Äôs allowing his staff to put out dirty used plates. 

Well according to the article I read, the manager flat out said he had told his staff to  not bother washing any of the dishes because there was a problem with the pipes- they were way over pressured, to the point where every time a faucet was turned on it basically flooded the kitchen. There is just too much water in the pipe.

So the investigator asks him why he hadn‚Äôt brought this up to get fixed, and the manager tells him that it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not even the pipes in the building, it‚Äôs the big underground one. And that it the affected pipe with the high flow was so far underground that the base bureaucracy wouldn‚Äôt approve the repairs.

Apparently he heard enough, cause he went back and reported all this to the old man. Understandably, he was too furious to speak. He just sat there for a bit until he finally says, ‚Äúlet me get this straight‚Ä¶.my men are sick because the low main has too much, MSG?‚Äù"

I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to get bash my meal like everyone else simply bc I‚Äôd be bouncing baby, and my fianc√© was a champ and would eat and then take her so I could eat. But you know how it is. Mom eats like half a portion‚Ä¶

Anyways things are wrapping up and I‚Äôm done with what I‚Äôm going to eat and am just ready to head home. 

Waitress comes to the table with three extra large chocolate chip cookies. Apparently they hand them out to the kiddos here, so she hands one to each twin, and then asks ‚Äúis she old enough to have a cookie?‚Äù

I must‚Äôve looked a bit crazy bc I laughed almost until I peed. Bc I immediately pictured our chunky monkey who can‚Äôt even sit up by herself yet just going to town on a cookie that is literally as big as her head. üòÇ without missing a beat tho, this waitress says ‚Äúhow about mom gets this one‚Äù


And then I did tear up bc it was such a simple and sweet gesture since my meal was a little lacking. ü•∞"

I'm (35M) dating someone (34F) who's now left two skid marks on my bedsheets and I have no idea what/how to tell her,relationship_advice,244,x5vjcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/x5vjcz/im_35m_dating_someone_34f_whos_now_left_two_skid/,207,1662319935.0,"*Edit: Thank you all so much for the excellent feedback! The period hypothesis is, if nothing else, a great way to broach the subject without embarrassing her. And of course I hope it's correct!*

Last  night was my second date with a woman I've had a good experience with  since meeting her on one of the apps. She checks all the usual boxes‚ÄîI  find her physically attractive, she comes across as a healthy,  well-balanced person, and we have decent enough chemistry, at least by  the standards of someone I've mostly still just met. Things have also moved a bit quickly, and we've had sex on both dates. But the  conversation in between has been good, and last night felt just as  natural as our first date, so I'm comfortable with the pace. She seems  to share my enthusiasm.

**The inciting incident:** Something unusual happened the day after our first date that I've never encountered in my dating life.

I uh... found a skid mark on my bedsheet.

To anyone for whom this would be an instant dealbreaker: I get it. I would have assumed I felt the same. But I think I was just **so** caught off guard‚ÄîI'm hardly a rookie to the dating world and nothing like this has *ever* happened‚Äîand it's **so** out of step with everything else I've observed about her‚Äî*she's just not the skid mark type!*‚Äîthat  I think I was eager to convince myself I misinterpreted it, or such an  outlier event I could write it off. So I threw my bedding in the wash,  and put it out of my mind.

**The ""oh god no"" moment:**  Last night was an even better date than #1. But sure enough, although  less obvious than last time, there's... another one this morning.

**The problem:** As cut-and-dry as I'm sure this situation sounds, I have **no idea** what to do. NO IDEA. I can only even conceive of three decisions, and all three sound unacceptable:

1. **Continue ignoring it.** Obviously out of the question.
2. **Tell her it's not working out, but leave this detail out.**  This just seems cruel. Nothing about our time together would suggest I've had anything less than a good time with her, and the idea of leaving her both confused and ignorant to information that would benefit her seems incredibly unfair.
3. **Tell her what's going on.** I'm sorry, but thought of *actually* having this conversation is just unbearable. The sheer *humiliation* of it all. How could I do that to someone? I know she deserves to know, but come on!

I expect I'm opening myself to a torrent of Reddit-style joke replies, which is understandable. But can anyone **please** offer some rational advice here? I'm completely at a loss."

"a lil rant from the perspective of a girl of colour, not living in an english speaking country",TwoXChromosomes,1001,x5ppbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/x5ppbm/a_lil_rant_from_the_perspective_of_a_girl_of/,161,1662305348.0,"this is directed to how western feminism can be so exclusive and be curated to only a certain demographic of women. basically, i believe the world has turned their backs on girls in the global south

in my opinion, from what ive seen, north america/europe (excluding eastern europe) rarely thinks of us anymore... for example when roe v wade was at the height of the media everyone (very rightfully) was upset, but... i dont think people understand how that ""calibre"" of anger is something girls in the global south/3rd world countries have to deal with every day.

i mean, girls in afghanistan cant go to school; fgm is still a widely used practice; 9 year olds are being sold to old men; teenage girls get acid attacked for rejecting boys; newborn baby girls are abandoned due to the preference for baby boys, especially in cultured homes (such as the one i was raised in) and... nobody talks about any of this. no accounts or websites that pride themselves on being brave and brazen and unapologetic feminists. you either fight for all women or no women.

i find it funny (read: upsetting) when people say ""womens rights are human rights"" yet the great majority of women dont even have said ""human rights"" in most corners of the globe. people are so desensitized to hearing stories about young girls getting gang raped in countries like india that it trends on pornhub, that you dont even hear of it anymore.

its like north america/europe is a whole other world that we (girls in 3rd world countries) don't have access to and people see us as less important. for example, if people *properly* obtained SA data including girls in the global south, results would SKYROCKET.

focusing on western feminism issues as well as feminism issues in developing countries are two things that can co exist. the only reason im making this post is because i dont see enough of it. women in my countries would speak up *if* it was safe, and i dont see much ""solidarity"" between feminists in english speaking countries and non english speaking countries.

the only nuanced discussions surrounding feminism i see nowadays are almost completely centered around north america/europe and i dont see how anyone can refute this.

sorry for the rant this is one of the few places i felt comfy saying all of this, thanks if u read until here."

This will go WAY further than moon. It's just to take a look at the numbers and if you're not totally regarded you will understand why.

Shares outstanding: **79M**

Shares held by Institutions / Insider: **85%**

**^(These shares are considered part of the shares outstanding, but because they aren't available for everyday trading, they're not considered part of a company's public float.)**

This leaves us with a publicly traded float of: **11M**

Shares officially shorted: **35M** ^(self reported, probably way higher)

I would like to say good luck to those who are short when the FTD numbers piles up and it's time to buy shares to settle those FTDs without making the price literally skyrocket with only 11M shares available. Which will leave the overall massive short postions under water and not even Jim Cramers buttplug will be able to keep it afloat.

&#x200B;

[These red FTD numbers right here is one of the factors for our latest run-up.](https://preview.redd.it/554r3kgiwvl91.jpg?width=988&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef770ce79c4b48894174c340cdae1b3628aca7e8)

As you can see the T+35 dates on the right side lines up perfectly with our previous run-up.

So how does the future looks?

[About the same amount of FTDs that caused our previous run-up is now bound to be settled. Now with almost the double $ amount as the price increased. \(poor hedgies\)](https://preview.redd.it/g4wtx0towvl91.jpg?width=1022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7c0a345a9cb11588767b599def386855d359755)

As you can see in the picture above the next interesting T+35 FTD period starts from 2022-09-14. Yes, there's a possibility they start settle/clear those FTDs earlier but so far they‚Äôve waited until the absolute last day. That‚Äôs why the T+35 dates is lining up so perfectly with our previous run-up.

But what's gonna be even more interesting is that we haven't yet seen the probably **ENORMOUS** FTDs that were created during our last run-up (Aug 15-18th) when the buy buttons made the FED printer look like a sloth. Those numbers will be released on Sept 15th.

The T+35 dates from Aug 15-18 is September 19-22 that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm expecting the rocket to leave earth‚Äôs surface.

As always keep your expectations in check. It‚Äôs all fun to speculate and hype. But be smart apes. Play your options safe. Far dated leaps with the goal to exercise aka DFV style to leave room for short-term errors. It might be a little more expensive but we‚Äôve seen so many people getting burned on their weeklys/short-term options on the Gamestop journey so far.

&#x200B;

[DFV Style](https://preview.redd.it/og989qqtxvl91.jpg?width=604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=156c3bc6e2e0a4dae7627ffa54f7cfce15e059b7)

So, with the numbers kept in mind on the top.

We funny enough have the same kind of setup here as the **VW Green Dildo Event in 2008**. But probably times 10 as the short interest is way higher.

&#x200B;

[I don't think they have the power to drop it that much lower, but who knows.](https://preview.redd.it/6nw2lse5yvl91.jpg?width=698&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e51be9fad81f2089c5b9ef551abeaf102f6510e6)

*As of the end of last week, Porsche said in a statement, it owned 42.6 percent of Volkswagen voting stock and held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled options on VW ordinaries -- giving it indirect control of 74.1 percent.* ^(Oh, 74.1% you say? Where have I seen that number before?) [^(https://imgur.com/a/WahAZg4)](https://imgur.com/a/WahAZg4)

*Since the German state of Lower Saxony holds just over 20% of VW, Porsche‚Äôs disclosure meant that, in fact, there were only 5% of VW‚Äôs shares left on the market (‚Äôthe Float‚Äô), whereas hedge funds had borrowed 13% of the shares and sold them short. It meant that, the hedge funds had to buy 13% of the shares and only 5% were available.. Porsche had cornered the market.*

There's no wonder the wasabi place is full of shills screaming ""bagholders"" ""the squeeze have squozen"" to make everyone sell. Hedgies R Fuk and the best part is, they know it. Their only small hope is that everyone sells. But here we are, still holding, many porfolios looking like a Wendy's dumpster fire.

But soon we will prevail and those mocking us will be seeing something fly outside their bedroom window while giving wife's boyfriend foot massage and this time it won't be a SpaceX rocket.

**It will be BBBY en route to Tendie Town.**

Long story short we used a fancy machine to look at the nutrient profile of animal feed. In the 4 years I worked there I picked up some pretty handy skills, like calibrating this $100,000 machine. 

I had to leave that job for part of my education, and chose to not go back after that semester due to it being 20+ miles away in another town. So I took a similar lab job at a local milk processing plant. After the initial training on all of their equipment, I started working on their huge backlog of moisture samples on a very similar machine to what I ran at the feed lab. My manager ( literally my age, same university, graduated at the same time, we even took classes together)even went as far as reminding me that this is why I was hired. 

Once a month we had to calibrate, so as I ran the appropriate tests and started the calibration process, my manager( who had never worked the lab)  starts berating me that I‚Äôm doing it wrong. In a rather loud (the plant manager used the term unprofessional ) ‚Äú discussion‚Äù  I warned her I would have no part of the blame for this bad ‚Äúcalibration‚Äù and she began insulting my education ( a lowly ag degree versus her biology degree), etc‚Ä¶

Ok Boss, we‚Äôll do it your way‚Ä¶. And we did until I left 2 months later to use my degree‚Ä¶ i found out after I left that there was a huge recall of  MILLIONS of pounds product because of a moisture issue‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs almost like somebody warned them‚Ä¶

In most instances I can manage it, but a lot of situations can get really tense for me and make it tough and that's just sort of unavoidable. And weed takes the stress off a lot, and helps filter through the bullshit to a certain extent. When I'm dealing with a lot of stress or even go into work (I work retail fyi) sometimes I will just take a few rips and I will feel a lot better.

But I got into an argument with a friend of mine who said this is deeply problematic, and that I'm using weed as a coping mechanism and trying to run away from my problems. But I see it as no different than any other medication and see it as something that simply can keep me in check and make life more manageable to a certain extent. But I need an unbiased perspective. Is it bad that I use weed in this sort of way?"

They didn't verify their information, avoided giving proof ( Posted public profile picture, linked wikipedia link, did the whole ""trust me, I'm me... "", and gave no reason to believe it is him.   While I'm uncertain if it is him or not, this family talk still needs to happen.  


I'm no web security expert, but let's have the family talk about internet safety :

First, don't give your personal information to anybody you don't know.  Be careful of sharing personal stories, and giving detailed info, just because you may believe the press is asking.

Phishing scams and social engineering all start with exactly this pattern.  Don't be trusting of people on the internet.  The pattern of getting someone in an emotional bind, then getting personal information is the classic pattern of social engineering hacks.

It appears that many folks were prompted to contact him through his email.   Be very cautious of giving out any information, until you verify the situation.   

As a reddit community, we should expect the great folks running this sub to do verification, expect proof of the verification too.   We are all here because we discovered the truth of TSCC, let's not fall victim to blindly believing someone ever again.

Thanks for showing up to this family discussion.   Be safe, be cautious and let's verify the truth.

343 doesn't understand casual HALO,halo,1057,x5sa88,https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/x5sa88/343_doesnt_understand_casual_halo/,114,1662311825.0,"My very first experience with HALO was in 2011, playing Halo Reach splitscreen custom games with my friend at his house and had the time of my life.

A week later after begging my mom (didnt want me playing shooters) I went and bought the game for myself. Me and my little brother spent 2 full days playing the campaign on local splitscreen, and it's what got both of us into gaming outside of basic nintendo games.

We didnt have the money to afford Xbox Live Gold so when we weren't playing splitscreen campaign we were making fun bases in forge and having fun just the two of us.

My next Halo experience was Halo 3 and I loved it just as much as Reach.

Then when Halo 4 came out I bought it and actually enjoyed myself, but not nearly as much as with the other games.

Halo 5 was when I lost touch with Halo. It was on a new console that I couldn't afford and it would require me to have Xbox Live Gold as well as my brother and any other friends I had. I didnt play Halo 5 until 2016 and by then my brother and friends had moved on. 

When Infinite came out I was very excited... until I played and saw how even the casual modes are total sweat fests, and ranked is drenched in sweat. I have nobody to play customs with anymore and even if I did there is no forge yet and the customs options themselves are broken. But ranked modes are celebrated by 343 as the future of the franchise which pisses me off.

When 343 said that Halo at its core is a competitive game, I looked back on all my memories of having fun with casual modes and tools and realized that this company doesnt understand HALO

TLDR: 343 focusing on competitive Halo is a slap in the face to all my memories having casual fun.

Edit: Thank you guys so much for your response to my Halo experience as I'm sure many of you had very similar experiences yourselves. Together we can show 343 that we know what Halo truly is and that they must course correct"

A lot of you need help,wallstreetbets,991,x5z9wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x5z9wj/a_lot_of_you_need_help/,501,1662329458.0,"This is more a commentary on the sub meta, but overlaps with a lot of online societal issues. Being one hundred percent sincere, a lot of you are showing signs of radicalization and genuine cult like behavior over meme stocks. 

This sub has always had its in jokes about gambling addictions and going long on $ROPE that alluded to some real life issues members would occasionally experience, but this is different. Ever since $GME, this sub has morphed into a genuine echo chamber which is fed by bot farms giving individual investors a false feeling of social support and acceptance for logically indefensible investing habits. Lets take a look at $BBBY. The CFO was witnessed by his wife committing suicide and the conspiracy theorists are already running out theories that this was to cover up nefarious activity by short sellers rather than just a man giving into despair. If you are looking at these theories and using them to justify continuing holding bags in $BBBY, I am talking to you. You need help. Talk to a friend or family IRL, delete reddit for a while, and just decompress.

This is a sub for making money. If your DD stops being about earnings reports and trend analysis, and starts being about international financial conspiracies killing the executives of a failing retailer, rethink what you‚Äôre actually doing and how you got here.

Edit: The cultists have found me out. I‚Äôve spent years undercover on this sub in preparation for this very piece of FUD. It‚Äôs just here to hold them back from that glorious moment that is definitely just around the corner where they will make millions, the hedgies will go bankrupt, and the NYSE and SEC will do nothing to stop the stock market erupting in turmoil."

I just read a thread with a bunch of votes on comments of people saying that it was totally natural for adult men to be attracted to teenage girls.

No the fuck it is not normal. 

Why does it matter if they look older than they are? Shouldn‚Äôt the fact that they‚Äôre literally still a CHILD, in school, studying for exams, just hit puberty, and all that stuff turn you off anyway? Why doesn‚Äôt it? 

I live in the UK, which means I have to wear a uniform for school. So it‚Äôs pretty clear that I‚Äôm under 17. I‚Äôm sick of being stared at by fossilised caravan-smelling men. They literally have no fucking shame. And it makes me feel so gross. My uniform shows nothing - the only skin I‚Äôm showing is basically my hands, my neck, and my face. All it shows is my age, and I don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs so attractive about being in secondary school. It is not fucking normal, get help. Hell, people stare at my chest more when I‚Äôm in uniform than not. 

When I search r / teen‚Ä¶ the results, apart from this sub, are all porn. All. Porn. And school uniforms are so extremely sexualised and no one bats an eye. 

I can also smell people from a mile away about to respond telling me that boys experience this too, and it‚Äôs also adult women who can be predators. I‚Äôm very aware, it‚Äôs exactly the same, and deserves the same attention and treatment. For example, it‚Äôs rape, not ‚Äúsex‚Äù or ‚Äúseducing‚Äù when an adult woman RAPES an underage boy. 

I‚Äôm just sharing my own experience. Stop sexualising teenagers, we don‚Äôt like it, it‚Äôs disgusting, we would like to finish our homework in peace, and get from school to home without being ogled at by grown ups. Please and thank you."

TIFU By Getting Carried away During Sex with the wife,tifu,92,x63505,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/x63505/tifu_by_getting_carried_away_during_sex_with_the/,19,1662340541.0,"Last night, the wife and I had our kids over at my parents' house and we went out to dinner, had some drinks, hung out with some people we hadn't seen in a while, and just generally had a good date night that married couples have.

We capped the night off the way that married couples tend to do when the house is empty.

My wife and I have never really talked about butt stuff except for the half joking, ""don't ever put it in my butt"" type of comments from my wife.  That's fine, it's never been something I've been in to, and I've never really pushed it or displayed any desire.

Well, before we went out, she took a long shower and got all gussied up for me, she looked great.

Anyway, I was about 3/4 of a bottle of wine and 3 beers deep when it came to do the deed.  To make a long, erotic-fitiony story short and believable, I decided to go down on my wife and went much farther south than I usually end up going.  It didn't interrupt anything, and she seemed to enjoy it the same as, if not a little bit more than, she usually does, so we finished off the deed and went to sleep.

It was eating me up inside all day, so when we got the kids to bed, I grabbed a beer from our bar and sat down for a heart-to-heart to apologize for violating boundaries and that I had gotten caught up in the moment.

Her response?

""What?  I didn't even notice.  I was too focused on you.  Now I feel awkward that I didn't notice.""

So, I felt guilty all day for potentially violating my wife, and she didn't even realize I had done it.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Tongue punched my wife's fart box, felt guilty for doing it unannounced, and come to find out that she didn't even realize I had done it."

The bread she can have is pretty expensive at \~$5 a loaf give or take. It gets pretty expensive buying special bread she can have all the time.

Im wondering if we can splurge on a nice bread machine to save money in the long run, especially having soy issues. Rhe biggest concern is if we would actually use it, time commitment to make the bread, and how much time it takes to clean. It may be cheaper, but is it easy to make bread and clean up? We would want to be as hands off as possible, since we live busy lives and just don't have time to micromanage bread.

Does anyone have a bread machine and can share their experience?

&#x200B;

Thanks for all the feedback, everyone! I'm gonna check some thrift stores and see if I can find one before I commit to a Zojirushi!"

People are congratulating a guy for getting a mail order bride. I hate Reddit sometimes.,TwoXChromosomes,9623,x5er01,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/x5er01/people_are_congratulating_a_guy_for_getting_a/,1008,1662268643.0,"This is human trafficking, right? Literally everyone was supportive. I don't understand. One commenter talked about his mail order bride and how he ""loves his Filipina"" as if she's a dog. What the fuck is wrong with people? 

This guy looked through a catalog and ""picked one"". He bought a person. I don't give a shit if poor you can't find love, you should never buy a human being. I just cannot fathom this. I hate Reddit.

EDIT: Someone gave Reddit Care Resources or whatever it's called a ring-a-ding-ding. I feel like I'm an official member of this sub now.

ANOTHER EDIT: I've read comments demonizing the woman who's going to become someone's property as a vixen who'll drain OP of his finances and then come for all he has when she divorces him. Poor OP is going to get ""taken advantage of"". 

That meteor came 65 million years too early.

EDIT THREE, THE ELECTRIC BOOGALEE: Here's to all you defending this man's actions in the comments. First, congratulations on finding your way out of Mother's basement. That must've been the most exercise you've gotten in years. More importantly, a lot of you assume this is happening in America, a real life episode of 90 Day Fiance. This is in Singapore, and the women this guy ""pick[ed] from a catalogue"" are supplied from either Singapore or Vietnam, places full of trafficking victims (Vietnam especially). There's a high chance that these women are being sold like animals either by their family or by the pimps of the establishments. There's a high chance they don't have a say. 

Sure, there's a chance OP's future bride is doing this on her own volition. There's no pressure, right? It's easy. Either sell your body to someone who's willing to purchase people like a choice steak at a butcher's shop, or continue to starve on the streets, living in squalor, hopeless and at the mercy of cold nights and an uncaring government! Unless, of course, you get assaulted by a wandering predator, develop an abscess from the vaginal tearing, only for it to burst so you slowly die of sepsis!

No pressure, right? It's totally fine to buy living people who have hopes and dreams to use them as walking sex dolls and maids, right? Why should we care about the women in these situations, right? Why should we do anything to combat the circumstances that lead to women either being pimped out, sold by their families, or sacrificing themselves to escape a horrific death when we can just have sex with them? Right?

Would you be so eager to let a strange man purchase your mother? Your sister? Your daughter? You? 

The doctor's called in, folks. He's prescribing you grass. Touch it.

EDIT NUMBER THREE PART TWO: When I wrote this post, the OP's post was still relatively new, and the comments were solely positive and upvoted. It appears someone unleashed a horde of sane people, because those comments are now downvoted and plenty of Redditors have rightly torn OP a new one. No, I'm not exaggerating what I wrote about regarding the comments. That's just how the comments were. Time is a thing, and it works."

The frequent (obviously at their dog) yelling followed up  by the yelping and the owners chasing the animal around whilst yelling makes it pretty obvious.

I have tried to contact the RSPCA to no avail. Without visual confirmation, they won't lift a finger. Fine, I get that, but they won't even talk to the owners, nothing. They've said so themselves, they won't even document the report. The one agency that is supposed to be looking after the welfare of animals, won't do a damn bloody thing about it. 

Does anyone know of an agency or a person/department that I can talk to where I can report this and actually get things done because god-knows RSPCA are f\*cking useless."

Try to break your system? Okay!,MaliciousCompliance,4742,x5ihy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/x5ihy2/try_to_break_your_system_okay/,174,1662282670.0,"Many years ago, I was unhappy in my job at a University and applied for a job doing the same thing at another prestigious UK institution. They ultimately turned me down as they felt they could get my skills cheaper elsewhere and already had my UK knowledge and experience within the University. Fine, these things happen. I felt it was a bit shortsighted but didn't dwell.

Eventually I moved onto another institution regardless. However, my group of similar type employees from across the UK got invited to the institution that turned me down to see their new self service application that they had just finished developing. 

When we arrived, the guy in charge, who had taken the decision to not bring me on board, went on and on about how fantastic this new system was and how the testing was really thorough and everyone loved it. Don't get me wrong, it looks fantastic and flowed really well.

He then used the words ""go on, try to break it, we've tested it really thoroughly"". Okay, I will.

Now I know the technology they used to develop it inside out. There are search screens you use to find and open records, and a button you can use to return to the search scren and view a different record or search again. When building self service functionality, you disable this button, obviously, so that students can only view their own records and your code does the search and open behind the scenes. I could see that they had disabled this button, not a problem. But I also knew of a bug in the technology.

So, I sit down and log in as a test user and start working my way through the screens until I get to the section that collects the Protected Characteristics (disability, ethnicity, sexuality etc - basically the stuff you collect and have to keep very private). I then pressed the key combination shortcut for 'return to search'. Immediately I have a the search functionality for this protected characteristic screen, and can search all records and view everyone's entries. So I find the presenter's test entry and call him over. His face turns white. This system is live. It's being used by students right now.

While scrambling to get his mobile phone out, I continue to scroll through other search results and show that it works on the other screens in the application too. Eventually the guy that they hired instead of me shows up and says 'we disabled the button, I don't understand'. Me: it's a very well known bug in the technology we use. You can't stop it working, but you can prevent the search results returning anything other than the records belonging to the person logged in.'. The presenter was absolutely furious, fuming that they'd have to shut down their new system until this issue was fixed, and they'd just gone live with massive (internal) fanfare.

So, yeah, the University that wouldn't hire me because they could get the same skills cheaper ended up paying to borrow my time from my new employers to get me to clean up the mess the cheaper skills made."

I just finished my master's degree at a school here, so that was the reason I moved here. But I love the area and career opportunities, so I'm staying. Despite a pretty impressive pay, I'm still a bit short on my living expenses. The amount they give me is about 10% of my rent every month. It helps tremendously, and I'm extremely appreciative, and my parents can afford it (it's not like they're scraping by to help me). I work really hard (about 48hrs a week), so it's not like I'm lazy and expecting them to cover me. I'm also single, and have no children.

Anyway, I know this is super long, but I just wanted some opinions. Only my really close friend knows, and I'm too nervous (almost embarrassed) to tell anybody else. Should I be embarrassed? Is it pathetic?

Edit: thank you for the comments everybody! I appreciate the honestly (both the supportive and more critical comments)

Edit 2: A few people have asked if I would rely on them permanently. No, I won't. My goal is to get my doctorate, but that is going to take time since I'm required to work 1-2yrs before the program. The doctorate will double my pay (if not more). Also, I will be paying my $1300 student loan per month (once the pause stops), so that takes a huge hit on my income. College debt sucks!   "

The lawyer looks annoyed, and turns to him.  ""No, no I don't.  I don't believe in giving handouts to bums.  But I tell you what,"" he said, handing him a business card, ""if you come to my house tomorrow morning, I will pay you to do some chores around my house.""  The homeless man agrees.

Sure enough, right on time, the homeless man knocks on the lawyer's door.  ""OK,"" said the lawyer, ""your first chore is go take these two cans of brown paint and this brush, and go out back and paint my porch.""  ""Sure thing,"" replies the homeless man.

A few hours pass, and the homeless man knocks on the lawyer's door again.  ""All done,"" says the homeless man.  The lawyer is a bit surprised he is done so fast, but he gives him $50.  ""There,"" the lawyer says, ""doesn't it feel better to work for an honest buck painting a porch instead of begging for it on the street?""

""Well, I suppose,"" sighs the homeless man.  ""By the way, that isn't a Porche, it's a Ferrari."""

Before he supported me when I would express anger or concern every time I‚Äôd see protesters at planned parenthood, he has known my stance since the beginning. That I am not here to judge other women and it should be legal. Especially since it will just create unsafe abortions. He brought up the fact that his ex had an abortion and it seems like he‚Äôs generalizing all these women. He thinks that 90+% of women get it as a second form of birth control. That if I think it‚Äôs okay then I must think what his ex did is okay. Yet on the other hand when I bring up counter arguments he says yeah but those are medical abortions and are a different category or if it was rape/incest it‚Äôs a necessary procedure.

Very welcoming to all, but they essentially demand that you respect it being a space for that community.

Anyways, I don‚Äôt pass, but I threw on an outfit that at least made me feel more confident. I was terrified at first, but the girl next to me started chatting, I introduced myself by my preferred name, and she was immediately welcoming. A couple of other folks, including the woman working the door, caught on, introduced themselves, and were as friendly and cool as could be. The door girl even pulled me aside to make sure I felt safe and welcome.

Good Satan Almighty, that was the most comfortable I‚Äôve felt as myself in my life, and I‚Äôm making it my new go-to spot."

Sup Mods? Let‚Äôs try this again and maybe don‚Äôt remove it this time... JUST EXPERIENCED THE MSM FUD ON RYAN COHEN FIRST HAND TONIGHT WITH MY FAMILY,Superstonk,507,x64h5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x64h5m/sup_mods_lets_try_this_again_and_maybe_dont/,54,1662344625.0,"My parents just said ‚ÄúWe heard about your Ryan Cohen guy‚Äù referring to the tragic towel situation. 

I told them it was MSM BS & the people pushing that narrative are financially aligned against GME & Cohen. How convenient that they have this hit piece ready to go within 24 hours without any due diligence or genuine factual reporting. I told how Cohen had bought nearly a year ago but they only conveniently reported it recently as the stock was rising to craft a narrative. Then towel did literally the opposite of pretty much everything Cohen told them and he sold, which they tried to spin as a pump and dump. 

They were leaning my way but were hesitant to completely believe me until I showed them [THIS VIDEO](https://youtu.be/ZggCipbiHwE)‚Ä¶ then they stfu, sat in awe & FINALLY believed. 

My Dad literally said ‚ÄúIm going to have to watch that again later, that was pretty disturbing.‚Äù We both jokingly said *‚ÄúThis is extremely dangerous to our democracy‚Äù* but he was visibly shook, like he had just seen Oz behind the curtain for the first time or finally got a glimpse outside of the matrix. Maybe this video can help you too. Fight the FUD. Its easy to HODL and just stay zen when you know the truth. Cheers

Edit: Not sure why the mods decided to remove the previous post as this is directly on topic for this sub. So, here‚Äôs attempt #2 to share something with the community that I know first hand helped multiple people better understand the situation with the MSM, their corporate interests and how that aligns with GameStop. GameStop IS THE ONLY investment that matters and MOASS is inevitable. The float *WILL* be locked much sooner than later."

* The idea of community creations was pushed early into development, but AEW refused. They changed their minds later but by then features would have to be cut to make it happen. Unsure if this feature will make into the game.
* Heavy resources were put into the Story Mode with multiple talents doing voiceover such as John Silver, Orange Cassidy and MJF (who wrote a promo for the game). 
* At one point there were story mode materials that were set to be prepared for The Bunny, Ricky Starks and Keith Lee, but there was some backtracking on that. Unsure where it stands now.
* In addition to FTR, Evil Uno, Jake Hager, Private Party, The Acclaimed and Santana & Ortiz are also not part of the initial release of the game. 
* FTR is currently planned to be released later as DLC.
* Kenny Omega is expected to present the game at Tokyo Game Show.

In the Eternals I found it to be quite jarring. I understand that they wanted to juxtapose an epic superhero movie with a contemplative song(and of course it has the 'end of the world' theme) but I think it simply didn't fit.

On the other hand, the song as used in Girl, Interrupted during the scene where Susanna returns to Daisy's apartment and it was completely effective. It added to the uneasiness of the scene yet the soft pace and melody contrasted the tragedy that was about to be discovered.

We had been itching to get back out for a while. We finished our putts on 18, turned around and saw no one was on course behind us. I asked him if he wanted to go play 18 again for fun, he agreed and we walked to the tee box. 

18 is a par 3, 180 yards and was straight into the wind today. I walk up and send a worm burner with my 4 hybrid that gets no where close. He walks up to the tee, 1 practice swing, hits a smooth 4 iron, bounces on the green twice and slowly rolls in. He aced it.

I was super excited for him because it was a crazy shot, maybe the shot of a life time. He‚Äôs excited but seemed conflicted since it‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt in regulation and not on the scorecard. 

Would you all consider this an ace for you golf bucket list? I‚Äôve been hyping him up all night but I think he feels like it‚Äôs not 100p legit since it didn‚Äôt count towards his score."

Chile es un pa√≠s mestizo, todos llevamos una ensalada de ascendencias que nos convierten a todos en chilenos, no en un apellido o una raza, todos hemos gritado los goles de la roja, hemos pasado angustias con desastres naturales y nos hemos esperanzado cuando vemos a nuestro pa√≠s ponerse de pie.

Ac√° tenemos que remas TODOS para el mismo lado y NADIE debe estar por sobre la ley o por sobre los derechos de otros chilenos.

2. FIN AL REVANCHISMO

Una constituci√≥n no puede ser una herramienta para pegarle a quien consideras tu adversario (y en muchos convencionales tu enemigo) pol√≠tico. 

Una constituci√≥n es la ley fundamental de una naci√≥n y debe estar a la altura de ella. No se puede hablar de dignidad si la ley fundamental fue manoseado de forma indigna.

3. LA POBREZA NO ES VULGARIDAD

Ya basta de simbolismos e im√°genes inspirados en la destrucci√≥n, la basura y la caca. Ese clasismo denigrante que asocia los sectores populares con banderas en el ano y comercie cerrado.

√âste pa√≠s necesita una red de cobertura que sustente servicios a nivel nacional que permitan acceder a una vida digna dentro de la mayor de nuestras posibilidades, ESTO es lo que pidi√≥ la gente.

4. LOS TONTOS √öTILES NO TIENEN REPRESENTACI√ìN CIUDADANA

Las ‚Äúmisas‚Äù de los viernes en Plaza Italia y el olor a meado de Valpo no representan a los que est√°n m√°s desaventajados, representan a ninis que est√°n en modo anarcO-delincuente porque ‚Äúla miseria ama la compa√±√≠a‚Äù.

El estar a dispuesto a militarle a una elite extremista no te hace representante de nada.

5. NO M√ÅS TERRAPLANISMO ECON√ìMICO

Las pol√≠ticas populistas como el retiro de fondos fue la principal causa de la inflaci√≥n y va a gatillar una crisis en las pensiones futuras.

Queremos generar v√≠nculos con el mundo desarrollado para avanzar hacia all√° y no aspirar a lo que representa hoy el resto de Latinoam√©rica y el caribe. Nadie sali√≥ a la calle a pedir que esto fuera prioridad.

Hay que enfocarse en hacer crecer la torta para que a todos les toque m√°s, ya basta de la l√≥gica de ‚Äúquitar los patines‚Äù o el demencial ‚Äúdecrecimiento econ√≥mico‚Äù tan vociferado en la constituci√≥n.

We've seen this before. It doesn't work anymore. Get rekt hedgies because you're running out of shit to pull. We've seen it all before.

I'm, as usual, completely untouched by all the bullshit and emotional baiting going on here in the weekends. 

I'm DRSed, tapped out, waiting patiently and unhurriedly for my favorite stonk to do something cool. It's alright GME - you can go whenever you feel like it.

I don't give zero fucks about whatever inconsequential drama going on this weekend.

I just want to use this opportunity to say one more thing I've been thinking about all day: whether there's proof the DTCC committed fraud or not, I think there's good grounds for an investigation under a court of law. **Regardless of the outcome of an eventual suit, I think we can all agree that IF A COURT CASE GOES TO THE DISCOVERY PHASE, there will be a very good chance that the public will see some numbers**. The DTCC has an obligation to ensure that the split procedures are followed. That means they must be able to provide some numbers - how many shares did they receive from the issuer via CS, how many participants were given how many locates. I think there's a good chance here to actually get to see some numbers on some of the rehypothecated and synthetic IOUs out there. 

Alright that's it. Back to dreaming about soup"

Usually when I look, something about periods is the most upvoted answer. When you sort by controversial, however, the answers usually have something to do with men hating women, or being treated differently due to your gender. 

It‚Äôs not that periods don‚Äôt suck - I even had to have a hysterectomy because of them - but if we have access to healthcare, we can usually try and do something about them. I can‚Äôt do anything about other people‚Äôs behavior.  

If you truly want to know more about women, you‚Äôre going to hear things that make you uncomfortable. 

The truth is, many men are responsible for making our lives harder. And many women live happier, healthier lives when men are not around. Many men are the cause of abuse, fear, and death. I wish it wasn‚Äôt like that, but it is what it is. 

You have the power to learn and be better, but it takes work. Women can‚Äôt do it for you. I have a wonderful, loving partner who is as good as he is because he‚Äôs done the work and pulled his weight. If you want to be that kind of person for someone else, you need to do that work too."

I just feel so hopeless and dull. I miss my mom's voice, my dog barking, just everything in general. The things I wished I could rip my ears out to stop hearing are the same things I'd give anything to hear one more time now. I sleep all day. My friends probably think I'm dead. My mom won't stop crying. I can't stop crying. Nobody understands me when I try to speak. Communicating is the worst. I hate it. Nothing matters to me anymore. My future is in the trash. Everything I've loved about life is gone.

I Wasn't Going to Waste Energy Using Anti-Barrier Sniper Rifle But Borealis is Too Much Fun!,DestinyTheGame,287,x5uza3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/x5uza3/i_wasnt_going_to_waste_energy_using_antibarrier/,75,1662318545.0,"Borealis's awesome and underrated effect, Ionic Return, transfers one bullet from your reserves to your magazine when breaking any enemy shield, but what makes this better is that if you break the enemies shield with a matching energy type you gain around a 40% damage buff to your magazine. To run Anti-Barrier Sniper mod it cost a ridiculous 6 energy but we need it on right. Why not run it with ""Shield Break Charge"" mod. It only cost 1 energy and pairs extremely well with Borealis. You become Charged with Light by breaking a combatant shield with the matching energy. You can fire all three energy types from Borealis. Throw High-Energy Fire on another piece and now Borealis is dishing out 60% more damage after breaking an enemies shield with the matching energy type. You can have up to 5 long range bullets dishing out 60% more damage if you break the enemies shield with the first bullet of the magazine. This thing rocks!!

Edit: u/ForestLime tested by running Sniper Holster on your leg armor you still KEEP the Ionic Return damage buff if you have the sniper automatically reload for you. No need to keep finding shields to pop!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LJ\_esrNFFw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LJ_esrNFFw)

This is extremely beneficial over other exotics like Arbalest when enemies shields match the burn type. Yeah sure, why not just just run Arbalest or anything else. But also why not have some fun. Sitting back like a true sniper and scanning the field with Borealis to pop those shields with the matching energy type to get that damage boost. For the most part Destiny 2 enemies are NOT random so knowing what enemies are using what shields is not hard! Getting that 60% damage boost from Borealis is a lot easier and consistent than you may think.

Edit: Thank you guys so much for the support again. Remember we all know there's meta weapons in the game that just outclass other weapons. Using ALL what the game has and not holding yourself to those stronger weapons make the game fun and enjoyable for some people. Here is the build.

My 2 cents that very well could be wrong: Only thing I'm focused on right now is the plaintiff. It seems odd to me that this self-representing, lawyer, plaintiff knew exactly when to purchase over 8k of $towel stock so that they could file this lawsuit fairly quickly. Seems like they had it ready to go or these things only take a week and a half to get together/court-ready? They did it fairly quickly (I am no lawyer so it could have been slow for all I know - I just assume you want to cross your T's and dot your I's on a lawsuit where you name a division of one of the largest bank's in the world as a defendant). It could be a coincidence though.Got to take a break for a little.

>Following the Play-In Stage Draw, we will conduct the Group Stage Draw. The remaining 12 teams have been sorted into three Draw Pools based on past regional performance. These three pools will be sorted into four groups of four for the Group Stage of the World Championship.

^(Source: https://lolesports.com/article/tune-in-for-the-worlds-2022-draw-show!/blte31d58b71aa77fd8)

For the sake of example, let's say EU1 is in group A. EU1 must have two of either PCS1, VT1, NA2, CN2/3 or KR2/3 in this group. (Must have 2 unique regions in their group)

All of the regions that are possible to be in EU1's group are also in play-ins, so if EU2 is in B, and EU3,4 get out of playins they are forced into C,D, it would force the two teams that come out with EU3,4 to be in groups A & B, but the teams that get out can both be blocked from going into group A.

For example, let's pretend the two regions that are in EU1's group are PCS1 and CN3, then if PCS2, CN4, EU3, EU4 get out of play-ins, the groups will not be valid, since none of those teams can go into group A, and the groups will have to be shifted around/redrawn."

Honking at elderly pedestrians is NOT ok,fuckcars,273,x5wj1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/x5wj1p/honking_at_elderly_pedestrians_is_not_ok/,49,1662322472.0,"My mom was trying to pull into a parking spot (in a lot with plenty of other free spaces), but an elderly man with a walker with his back turned to us was partially blocking the spot and was clearly waiting for the rest of his group by their car. Instead of rolling down her window to ask him to move, she just honked at him, he jumped as he was startled, and shuffled out of the way. I couldn‚Äôt believe my mom would think this was appropriate, and called her out on it immediately. She said she assumed he was deaf because he couldn‚Äôt hear the van and became super defensive about it, refusing to believe that activating what‚Äôs essentially an air horn right behind a person who could be medically vulnerable is dangerous and unnecessary. 

We had a huge fight about it and are currently not on speaking terms. The worst part (and the most hypocritical) is that I‚Äôve seen my mom get extremely upset *while in her van* when someone else has honked at her for taking too long to do something. How can she believe honking at an elderly pedestrian is a valid option?"

Finally upgraded to having my consoles on the wall.,gaming,958,x5tehz,https://i.redd.it/f9873amdtvl91.jpg,171,1662314645.0,"I‚Äôm so happy to get some floor space back. 

I went pretty overkill on making sure the boxes are securely attached (same for the TV mount) to the wall.  I have access to the studs behind this particular wall and introduced some 2x6 stringers at each location where a shelf is attached. 

Each custom box currently also has a slot cutout for cables to route into the box, and then through the wall (in the future, see below) and I routed out a recessed foot print for each console. Tipping is always possible, but they can‚Äôt (shouldn‚Äôt) slide around on the shelves. (I hoping I made them small enough and they are cluttered enough to prevent cat intervention‚Ä¶) I‚Äôm planning to design some basic ‚Äòtop mount clips‚Äô that I can 3D print for each console, giving a finger to hold the top more securely. Attaching them with 3M command strips should give the basic steadiness I‚Äôd prefer to have. 

This is a temporary setup; eventually I‚Äôd prefer to route the cables through the stud wall for the best concealment. Future design will hopefully better orient the consoles. 

All the boxes were made from scrap wood that I had around. I‚Äôd been wanting to do this for some time now. Just decided to make it happen. 

Also, PSA: do not think or convince yourself that a TV with only 2x HDMI plugs is acceptable‚Ä¶.."

Married But Looking,CFB,319,x61ivr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/x61ivr/married_but_looking/,82,1662335804.0,"Hi, I‚Äôm Nebraska. I‚Äôve been married to Scott for almost five years, but we‚Äôre having irreconcilable differences and I‚Äôm about to be back on the market.  

I‚Äôve had a lot of interesting relationships over the decades. Some were great, some were mistakes. Back in the ‚Äò40s and ‚Äò50s there were some guys, I don‚Äôt even remember their names anymore.  

But then this guy Bob came along in 1962 and changed my whole life for the better. Back then I was a loser with nothing going for me, but Bob built me up and made me great. Within a decade I was on top of the college football world.  

Next was Tom. Tom and I were together for 25 years. We loved each other so much. He could be boring and stubborn, sure, but he was a really good guy and a consistent provider. Tom also had a wild & dangerous side, and we experimented with the Fumblerooski and option. We had a little rough patch in the late ‚Äò70s - he thought about leaving me for Colorado - but most years were great, a few even magical. In the early 1990s he changed from a 5-2 to a 4-3, and that really spiced things up for us for a few years. The best years of my life, actually üò¢.  

Then there was Frank. We had a good (not great, but good) relationship for about six years. Frank was an 8, but my buddy Steve Pederson was so sure that I could pull a 10. Steve thought I was gravitating toward mediocrity with Frank. I believed him. So I broke up with Frank in 2003. He moved to Ohio.  

I was single for 40 days, and got rejected by some 4s during that time. That should‚Äôve been a wake-up call, looking back. I really didn‚Äôt like being single so I shacked up with Bill in January of 2004. We never really loved each other, mostly neither one of us wanted to be alone and couldn‚Äôt do any better. So we settled for each other. He was a west coast guy, but I‚Äôm a midwest person. He brought in a lot of money, but after four years we didn‚Äôt have much to show for it, and still felt broke.  

Then Bo came back into the picture. I had known him for a year back in 2003 (even had a brief fling in San Antonio in December 2003) and we rekindled things. It went well for a while because we still had a lot of Bill‚Äôs money leftover. Bo also had a cat. We had a lot of good times, but he often couldn‚Äôt perform under pressure, if you know what I mean. That caused tension between us. Bo also had a temper, and honestly it was pretty bad sometimes. We moved from the Big 12 to the B1G, and things were harder for us in our new home. Then he said some mean things about me after the Ohio State game in 2011 behind my back‚Ä¶. the kinds of things you just can‚Äôt take back. Two years later I heard secret recordings of what he had said, and the relationship went downhill quickly from there.  

Then there was Mike, my rebound. Shawn Eichorst, my buddy at the time (and who turned out to be a total douche), set me up with him. Mike was a really nice guy - too nice, maybe - and there was just no spark there. Lasted 3 shaky years and then fell apart. He quit on the relationship, and so did I.  

Then in the fall of 2017 I reconnected with *him*. Scott. He was going to be ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù It was going to be a fairytale relationship, and we were gonna grow old together. I‚Äôd known Scott well for a couple years back in the ‚Äò90s. We had lost touch with each other, but I kept seeing on ESPN how well he was doing, and I knew I just had to have him back. While I was breaking up with Mike I made my play for Scott. He was in a relationship with Central Florida at the time, but our mutual friend Matt Davison let him know I was very interested. Florida wanted him too, but he and I had history together, and he chose me! He was so successful at the time and everybody thought it would work out between us, we‚Äôd be happy together forever. Well, it‚Äôs been almost 5 years of promises about how he‚Äôs going to change and get better, about how he‚Äôs just about to turn that corner once he catches a break. Well, I just don‚Äôt have any trust in him anymore. I knew it deep down a year ago, but wanted to give him one more chance. Oh well, he just can‚Äôt get it together. And now It‚Äôs over. I mean, not officially, but we both know it. The kids go off to college October 1. I might break up with him right then, or maybe I‚Äôll wait until the holidays. But it‚Äôs inevitable.  

So here I am, about to be single again. In the past I‚Äôve felt like I was attractive enough to lure somebody great. But I‚Äôm scared this time. My facilities are getting old, gray, and a little saggy. Other programs put out more in NIL. I‚Äôm not sure anybody would want me anymore.  

I‚Äôll see if my buddy Trev can hook me up with a hottie. Maybe I‚Äôll try to slide into Urban Meyer‚Äôs DMs. But honestly, I‚Äôm pretty worried that I‚Äôm a has-been that just doesn‚Äôt have anything that sets me apart anymore, and that I‚Äôll have to just swipe right on anybody with a pulse and hope to get a match.  

Sincerely,  
Nervous in Nebraska  üéà"

Knowing he is about to land a new financing deal for the company made him hold 5/6th of his shares‚Ä¶ it is very unfortunate but signs point to something else. No note and he did not open a window.

 ""I don't really like people who are too smart. They think that they can control everything, and constantly venture to the fringes of danger. But Alhaitham is one of the more reliable ones.  In most cases, he is actually in control of things and has the ability to avert potential disaster.""

[Nilou About Kaveh](https://twitter.com/Ubatcha1/status/1566514646273736704?cxt=HHwWgIC-qayxsL0rAAAA)

I heard he was the one who built the magnificent Palace of Alcazarzaray. He must have had a wonderful time making such a masterpiece, like when Im in the middle of dance practice. Just thinking about dancing for everyone gives me so much happiness and motivation 

[Cyno About Tighnari](https://twitter.com/Ubatcha1/status/1566500085457887232?cxt=HHwWgICx5eXhqb0rAAAA)

Tighnari once told me not to tell jokes at the dinner table, insisting that my jokes weren't funny at all. I did not share his opinion, so I told three of my best jokes in a row, and explained the premise of each in great detail. By the time I was done talking, my food was cold. 

[Cyno About Collei](https://twitter.com/Ubatcha1/status/1566470610976477186?cxt=HHwWhMC85ZOunL0rAAAA)

 I once helped Collei seal away the god's remains in her body, but the process was unthinkably painful one. To many, enduring that kind of pain would be a prospect more terrifying than death, so it was very admirable that she was able to persevere through it all. 

[Candace About Dehya](https://twitter.com/Ubatcha1/status/1566530610935521282?cxt=HHwWhICzqc7St70rAAAA)

 Whenever Dehya brings any of her Eremites to stay at Aaru Village, she always keeps them on their very best behavior. I have to say, it makes my life a lot easier. Ah, Dehya... She might look like trouble at first, but the truth is that she's really quite adorable 

[Candace About Lesser Lord Kusanali](https://twitter.com/Ubatcha1/status/1566530430785945603)

 Perhaps it is a testament to the Dendro Archon's benevolence that I, a descendant of the Al-Ahmar bloodline, am able to live peacefully on this land. If so, I suppose I am grateful for this much, but... I am first and foremost a child of the desert. 

[Nilou About Lesser Lord Kusanali](https://twitter.com/Ubatcha1/status/1566452879396933633)

 The people of the Great Bazaar love Lesser Lord Kusanali. I'd love to hear her thoughts on my Dance of Sabzeruz... Oh, no, no, forget it... If she were in the audience, I'd get stage fright...

[Nilou About Tighnari](https://twitter.com/Ubatcha1/status/1566452760723300353)

 I hear he's a really talented botanist. He must be good at telling apart mushrooms. At least, he would never have to worry about eating a poisonous one... I'm so jealous.  

[Cyno About Faruzan](https://twitter.com/Ubatcha1/status/1566423031190364160)

 I've carefully browsed through the case files regarding Faruzan's disappearance. At the time, I thought maybe she had been conducting some kind of dangerous research, but once I met her in person, I completely abandoned that idea.  Though it might be a little hard for me to get along with her, she mostly reminds me of a kindly and chatty parent. She is considerate of others, and would never do anything imprudent. 

 [Candace About Alhaitham](https://twitter.com/Ubatcha1/status/1566406377441992707)

A truly unusual scholar, unlike any other I've ever met. He sees and thinks about things in his own unique way... I only hope he never wields his sharp mind against the peace of Aaru Village. 

[Nilou About Collei](https://twitter.com/Ubatcha1/status/1566196010237542400)

She sometimes comes to watch my performances. She's a really hard-working Trainee Forest Ranger. One time, she warned me about getting lost. What did she mean by that? It's not like I've gotten lost before... 

 [Cyno About Kaveh](https://twitter.com/Ubatcha1/status/1566144538275729412)

Tighnari and Collei never said it to my face, but they found Kaveh's personal anecdotes far more entertaining than the jokes I had prepared... I could see it on their faces.  Hmm? What did I think about that? Well, I thought it was funny that they could laugh at such a situation.  

[Candace About Cyno](https://twitter.com/Ubatcha1/status/1566133035988312071) 

In the past, it was rare to see the Akademiya's General Mahamatra on this side of the Wall of Samiel, but recently he has been showing up here all the time. I believe that the Eremites have some truly terrifying stories to tell about him... 

[Nilou About Cyno](https://twitter.com/Ubatcha1/status/1566111782128828422)

 I don't really like interacting with people from the Akademiya because they don't view the arts too kindly. I often wonder what they do when they're bored... Huh, Cyno plays Genius Invokation TCG? I can't believe it..."

**Sep 4 2022 (Sun) 17:00 to Sep 11 2022 (Sun) 16:59 PDT**  
**[Sep 5 2022 (Mon) 0:00 to Sep 11 2022 (Sun) 23:59 UTC]**

1. Complete all of this week's Master Missions
2. Defeat 3 Saber, Caster, or Berserker-class Servants
3. Defeat 3 Archer, Lancer, Rider, or Assassin-class Servants
4. Defeat 15 Male enemies
5. Defeat 15 Female enemies
6. Acquire 15 EXP cards
7. Acquire 30 EXP cards

***To Complete (I won't be looking at Shishoufest)***:  
**With Free Quests and Hunting Quests:**  
Hunting Quests don't have Servants but this set will have plenty of male enemies for us. Since HQs also often drop EXP cards, farming HQs allows us to skip going to the Ember dailies. Unfortunately, the HQs this time around don't have a good source of female enemies. We'll have a day with Valkyries and Golems but you only fight one Valkyrie per run, so unless you're planning to drop some apples that day, it's not likely you'll get that done with just the HQs.

* **3 Septem Massilia** [3 Riders, 3 Berserkers, 3 Female, 15 Male] = 27 AP
* **1 Okeanos Bountiful Sea** [8 Female] = 18 AP

**Total: 45 AP**

This allows you to complete everything but the Females and EXP missions. You will need 4 more female enemies. If you're gonna farm some Aurora Steel, Valkyrie HQ is gonna have you covered there. You get female enemies and exp cards for the MMs, and you get steel.

---

For those of you that don't want the HQs at all, you can do something like:

* **2 Fuyuki X-E** [2 Rider, 2 Female] = 10 AP
* **1 Fuyuki No.0** [1 Saber, 1 Female] = 7 AP
* **1 Orleans Jura** [1 Rider, 1 Female, 5 Male] = 7 AP
* **2 Septem Massilia** [2 Rider, 2 Berserker, 2 Female, 10 Male] = 18 AP
* **1 Agartha Riverside Town** [9 Females] = 20 AP
* **EXP/Ember Dailies** = 30+ AP

**Total: 92+ AP**

You can do Okeanos Bountiful Sea and one more Fuyuki X-E if you don't have Agartha's Riverside Town available.

Will be updated if needed."

Most of my deaths are coming from effects I can‚Äôt see. This is a problem.,pathofexile,674,x5sl0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/x5sl0w/most_of_my_deaths_are_coming_from_effects_i_cant/,119,1662312594.0,"So, I have specced my atlas into ritual and expedition primarily. I‚Äôm playing a lightning conduit elementalist. When I‚Äôm doing a ritual, expedition, or whatever, there‚Äôs a lot going on on the screen. My orb of storms is firing bolts everywhere, galvanic field is up, there are elemental prolif circles everywhere, I‚Äôm dropping lightning bolts on the whole screen basically, plus I have hundreds of mobs and all their effects, some are glowing or flashing, some are firing projectiles everywhere, it‚Äôs a giant mess.

Now, the problem is that I can‚Äôt see all these archnemesis effects I need to avoid. Lightning mirages? My whole screen is lightning all the time. Magma barrier volatiles? Nope. Toxic bombs I can usually see, but not their ground effect. Permafrost is basically invisible on a lot of maps even with nothing on top of it. Heralding minions? Forget it.

I play a pretty tanky character. I have 5.7k life, grace, determination, purity of the elements, defiance banner, jade, stibnite, and granite flasks with good mods set to go off when I hit a rare/unique monster (which is functionally 100% uptime during rituals and the like), molten shell, elemental aegis, 77% all res, 40% chaos res, a bunch of evasion and armor on my gear, I have leech, ~40% recoup, recovery on kill, and devouring diadem‚Äôs corpse consume heal. I also have super high damage (all awakened support gems, unnerve and exposure on hit gloves, curse on hit rings, I‚Äôm inflicting 65% shocks, etc.). I‚Äôm generally not dying to monsters very frequently.

What is happening is during the chaos of a ritual, or expedition, or just a huge pack of mobs charging at me, I‚Äôll just randomly fall over dead because it turns out I was standing on creeping frost then got blasted by 4 lightning mirages or something. This should not be going on. This is not player error, I‚Äôm not dying because I‚Äôm doing something wrong. I‚Äôm dying because I can‚Äôt see the thing that‚Äôs killing me until it‚Äôs too late. These effects are not effectively communicating the danger they pose in many circumstances. In a vacuum, many of them are probably ok. If I‚Äôm in a open area and can see them coming, volatiles, toxic bombs, lightning mirages, etc. are pretty easy to dodge. The trouble comes when you can‚Äôt see them, which happens all too often in POE.

Something needs to be done about this. It‚Äôs becoming incredibly frustrating and making it very difficult to level now."

The reason being cut by the iron throne is such a big deal. [no book spoilers],HouseOfTheDragon,191,x60vm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseOfTheDragon/comments/x60vm2/the_reason_being_cut_by_the_iron_throne_is_such_a/,21,1662333928.0,"I'm writing this to provide some further context for non book readers as to why being cut by the iron throne is such a major taboo for monarchs, and is a sign that someone is unworthy of the throne. 

In essence, Aegon I was a genius when designing the iron throne. He made it so that no king could ever ""sit easy"" when seated upon the iron throne. If one were to relax, become angry, upset, or any other emotion that would cloud ones judgement, you would put yourself at risk of cutting yourself due to the blades of the iron throne. 

In this way, only a king who is absolutely calm, collected and composed could safely sit the iron throne and remain uncut. 

We see throughout the series that monarchs often cut themselves in fits of rage on the throne, or other strong emotions. Joffrey cuts himself when a man calls him a bastard, Viserys I cuts himself when he banishes Daemon, Aerys II cut himself all the time.

Perhaps most importantly, the only time we ever hear that Aegon I getting cut was when he was delivered a letter, the contents are unknown but presumably it was a graphic description of his sister-wife Rhaenys being tortured, this upset him so much that he gripped the iron throne so tightly it cut him. 

In short, when people are emotionally unstable, they cut themselves on the iron throne. A monarch who very rarely if ever gets cut is an emotionally stable and therefore generally good monarch.

Honestly I absolutely love that as worldbuilding from GRRM and I think the idea is great, the risk of tetanus from the cuts notwithstanding.

The most egregious case of a man cutting himself on the iron throne is Maegor the cruel, who was found dead on the iron throne with his arms sliced open. 

It is believed that the throne spurned him and killed him for being a cruel tyrant and unworthy, and therefore greatly contributed to the taboos of being cut by the iron throne. 

In all likelyhood, one of the many people that hated him had him assassinated, but the myth remains popular. 

TLDR: 

If someone cuts themselves on the iron throne, at that moment they were acting in a way that does not befit a monarch. 

Therefore there is truth to the claim that being cut by the iron throne is a sign of unworthiness.

EDIT: 

I've just been informed that Aegon I did not cut himself on the throne, but instead gripped the letter so hard his hands bled, which is an important distinction. 

It seems Aegon never cut himself on the throne, like an absolute champ."

I end up in debt or financially unstable to get a ""proper"" education. Then, almost broke, I have to BEG for a job and comply with sh*tty working conditions, so I can make a profit for a company that doesn't care about me.

That, of course, provided that you have 10 years of experience right after graduating. But don't be too old either ‚Äì We don't want people over 40 working for us.

So let me get this straight.

Companies need us workers. They do. We're profitable. But we're still the ones to beg for a miserable job and paycheck after ending up in debt in college.

The world would be much better if companies were the ones to invest in workers from the get-go. Teach them what they need for the position and have them gain work experience. It can't be that difficult.

Fuck this!

Normally I might actually enjoy this quiet period, knowing that a new league which will cause the game to come back to life is just on the horizon.

"PSA for why Mihoyo doesn't reimplement old story events or a way to replay them, and why it's not just FOMO",Genshin_Impact,2781,x5gen0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/x5gen0/psa_for_why_mihoyo_doesnt_reimplement_old_story/,306,1662274728.0,"# Introduction

Earlier today there was a post asking why Mihoyo doesn‚Äôt implement important story-related events into the game for new players. This also ties into ‚Äúwhy Mihoyo doesn‚Äôt let us replay events‚Äù. The most recurring answer on that thread was FOMO, which is fair, but it‚Äôs also an oversimplification. There‚Äôs quite a lot more to it than that.

## A development nightmare

First and foremost, consider the technical ramifications. It‚Äôd be a nightmare from a development standpoint, as it‚Äôs not just a matter of copy-pasting previous events into the game. Game design is incredibly complicated, and Genshin isn‚Äôt exactly a 2D png collector, puzzle clicker, or a static world. Rather, it‚Äôs a complex open world that is continually updating and expanding, and implementing anything creates the possibility (and not a small one) of breaking something else along the way. For example, some events alter the actual appearance of an area, NPC positions, enemy spawns, and so on. Adding something new, something even as trivial as a new vendor or fishing spot requires Mihoyo to ensure that it‚Äôll work for each version of the area and for all events. Think of that feeling when you begin a quest, and realise you can‚Äôt see the objective marker, so you go to your quests log only to see: ‚Äúso and so is currently involved with another quest‚Äù. That isn‚Äôt just exclusive to characters either, but very often NPCs that you‚Äôd least expect. That‚Äôs only one of the countless things that have to be taken into consideration with anything that‚Äôs implemented.

In fact, I just saw this myself thanks to u/BBjilipi, but during 2.8 GAA, one single chest fix made it impossible to talk to NPCs and continue the other quests, game-wide, for a whole day. That's one relatively minor tweak to an ongoing event that Mihoyo is actively monitoring that impacted the rest of the game.

Of course, it‚Äôs not impossible, but the cost of additional development, testing, and bug fixing would rapidly conflate with each new event and each new update. That‚Äôs not even going into the fact they have to possibly fix existing elements in the game to ensure nothing conflicts, and that‚Äôs for each and every event they reimplement. Afterall the tiniest thing that falls through the crack can again have a butterfly effect on the rest of the game. And don‚Äôt forget, Genshin is a game that‚Äôs going to be around for the long term. 10 more years if not more according to their 12-year content roadmap.

And on that note, let me reiterate: *the game will be around for 10 more years if not more.* Just imagine having to work each event into a permanent thing that 1. is consistent and functional with the rest of the expanding world, and 2. will function for every single player, no matter what stage of the story or progression of their world that they are at, for **10+ years**. That‚Äôs an unbelievable resource drain, and for what? *Well, we'll get to that later.*

## Implement story-relevant events as part of the core game

***‚ÄúSo then just add each of the story-relevant events into the core game, make them permanent‚Äù.*** Integrating story-relevant events as part of the core game sounds great on paper, but the game is already 20 GB on mobile. Imagine how big it would be if all the story-relevant events were added in like Archon quests. We‚Äôre talking gameplay, full-on cutscenes, changes in the world (environment, NPCs, enemies) ‚Äî and all of that compounded with voiceovers in 4 languages, dialogue text for 13 languages, and all the special music made for said event. Now that‚Äôs just for what we‚Äôve already experienced, but the game is constantly bringing in millions of new players each month. So they‚Äôd have to implement this for every relevant event going forward so that nobody misses anything. *For the next ten years.*

**‚Äú*****They‚Äôve shown that they can do download packs like with their Tears of Thermis game.*****‚Äù** Yes, they can, but all that solves for Genshin is the issue of space. They still need to ensure everything functions on a technical level, and also, right now we‚Äôre still in the early stages of Genshin‚Äôs lifespan. A new player now already has 150+ hours of core game content to play through.  But imagine a new player that joins in seven or eight years in (still not even close to the end of Genshin). Imagine how much content they‚Äôll have with just the core game experience, and then imagine them also having to download dozens of content packs on top of that each time they reach a new part of the story just so they don‚Äôt miss out on any details. And then tack on resin activities, any ongoing events, and actual exploration (which might I add is an enormous part of Genshin, as I‚Äôm sure all of us can relate). Even ignoring all that, I would not envy anybody that has to go through the cycle of downloading a content pack, deleting it, downloading the next, and so on. Each pack if I may add, has to be updated and tested by the devs with each update to ensure nothing breaks.

Even if they just add in a few and leave it at that ‚Äî the same complaints will pop up as soon as they launch any event with any important character/story development. And then we're back at square one with the same complaints.

It‚Äôs not that these are bad ideas. But when compounded with the developmental logistics of doing this for every important event in Genshin, every update, every year, for the Genshin‚Äôs entire lifespan, it‚Äôs simply too much of a hassle.

## Too much of a hassle, and for what?

Why does Genshin remain relatively bug-free compared to every other live service (and even paid game) out there despite its unprecedented content schedule? Well, a big part of that is obviously thanks to the development team over at Mihoyo not half-assing anything. But another part is because they don‚Äôt do unnecessary stuff like this.

Yes, they **can**. Sure. But for what? The majority of the player base is happy. New players are also happy. Their active player base has been growing for the past two years (63 million now and counting) while the majority of live service games end up losing players after two months or less. Mihoyo doesn't have any obligation to increase the number of possibilities for their game to break, while simultaneously exponentially increasing development costs/workload, **JUST** to provide something that we already have access to via YouTube. (Yes yes, we won‚Äôt be able to physically play the events or self-insert ourselves, but that‚Äôs a minor nuisance ‚Äî hardly anything to justify the workload that Genshin‚Äôs dev team would be put through)

Again, these suggestions aren‚Äôt impossible. But there are just too many downsides and things that can go wrong. It‚Äôs not worth it from a financial standpoint, a developmental standpoint, and even ‚Äî *and please don‚Äôt raise your pitchforks* ‚Äî from a player-based standpoint, since it‚Äôs something that not every new player will opt for, whether its due to them not wanting to constantly download content packs, or just not caring.

If anything, the best they could realistically do is a theatre feature where you could replay old cinematics, cutscenes, dialogue etc. But more than that, it‚Äôs just wasting resources on old stuff. And wouldn‚Äôt we all rather that they focus on the new?

## Conclusion

The whole deal with Mihoyo not reimplementing old events isn‚Äôt as cut and dry as ‚ÄúFOMO‚Äù. It‚Äôs a lot more complicated for them, even if they actually wanted to do so (which honestly isn‚Äôt out of the realm of possibility given that they‚Äôve done it for their other gachas).

Ending this whole ramble off, here‚Äôs a fantastic quote by another user (paraphrased): Don‚Äôt look at every decision by Mihoyo as ‚Äúhow are they trying to trick us into spending money this time‚Äù. Because sometimes, there's a little more to it.

*Thanks to* u/drag5pl *for the inspiration behind many of the important points here.*

Edit: So this post is getting flooded with downvotes which is unfortunate, so I'd like to elaborate that this isn't a ""don't criticise or say anything bad"" post. It's simply a different perspective on the situation that offers an answer other than ""FOMO"". I feel that since we all enjoy this game, it's nice to learn more about what's going on behind the scenes so we can have more complete and whole discussions going forward. So downvote or upvote, I still genuinely hope that this post provided some new insight into the topic!

Edit 2: Thank you everybody that replied, regardless of perspective. It's a bit hard for me to reply to everybody now that it's 11 hours in, but I appreciate all the constructive discussion that I was able to have with many of you. Just to speedrun through any questions/points I'm seeing brought up often by a small minority:

**1) We don't want playable story, we just want the cutscenes and dialogue. That doesn't require any of what you listed, and they already have the archives ready for this.**

Read through the paragraph before the conclusion. I want that too, and I've already said it's something that's feasible. The post is targeted more toward people who want replayable content, not to you. And again, I'm on your side [when it comes to this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/x5gen0/comment/in10887/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**2) BS, other gachas have no issue doing reruns. Mihoyo has no excuse not to.**

Read through the first half of my post. Most other gacha games don't have to deal with the technical and developmental issues of Genshin's breathing continually updating open-world.

**3) Storage, storage, storage, enough with storage! Just have them use download packs for all the events.**

This was a point that was actually bought up so often to my surprise. For those asking this, read through my post again. I already mentioned download packs. The issue is, that they don't fix the main problem: which isn't storage but rather all the regression testing. But no on another note, download packs are great, and I actually think them using download packs for cutscenes and dialogue playback would be fantastic.

**4) It's FOMO, plain and simple. Mihoyo's other games literally do this, after all, so there is no reason they can't do it for Genshin.**

This isn't really a point against Mihoyo as you'd think. The fact they do it for their other gachas shows they're perfectly willing and happy to let players redo limited content AKA ""FOMO where?"" But those gachas, like mentioned before, still don't have to deal with all the technical monstrosity that is Genshin. Hence why Mihoyo is able to do it for their other games but unable for Genshin.

**5) So it's technical incompetence then. You're saying Mihoyo who has earned billions off Genshin can't apply bug fixes to replayable content?**

This is a big one, so the answer for this will be a bit more comprehensive. In 2020, Destiny 2 faced the [same type of issue](https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2020/02/12/destiny-2-bug-fix-inventory-deletion/), in which a minor error was overlooked, but over the course of many patches, that one small problem snowballed into a catastrophic issue. Bungie, despite being a company far more massive and renowned than Mihoyo, was still blindsided. That's not to diss on Bungie's developers, but rather to say that money doesn't solve everything. When you have a live service game, and have to keep every bit of code functional, that's a significant workload. And not to mention, Destiny 2 makes these errors rather often for its budget, despite it having it easy given that Bungie removes story content with each expansion (and this is **paid content** as well) to make room for the next. So Bungie essentially gets a relatively fresh slate to work with each expansion, but it's still a huge task to ensure nothing falls through the cracks. Even for a dev team like Destiny's, who I'd assume are basically the best in the industry (given that Bungie is owned by Sony). Something like Genshin that will be growing for the next ten years with a continually expanding core game will have even more development, bug fixes, and testing to deal with. It's not so much technical incompetence as it is an unfeasible and overwhelming workload.

Anyway, that's it for the question speedrun. Everybody else, thank you again for the fruitful and interesting discussions and comments! Wish I could talk in-depth with all of you."

What happened to tackling?,CFB,71,x63xxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/x63xxc/what_happened_to_tackling/,73,1662343004.0,"I‚Äôm watching FSU vs. LSU right now, and I see a pass across the middle, receiver takes a step upfield as the safety meets him full speed. Safety lowers his shoulder and the receiver bounces off and runs for another 7-8 yards.

This is a tread I‚Äôve seen over the last few years at all levels. Defenders making hits by running into the ball carrier and trying to knock them over. Sometimes it works but often I see the ball carrier bounce off for more yards. 

Why do players not wrap up the ball carrier and drive them into the ground anymore. As a kid we were always taught to get low and wrap the legs. When you wrap the legs, if you don‚Äôt get the tackle you at least keep them in place for the next man. Is this not taught to players anymore? Is it the new rules that created this trend? What is it?

P.S. I‚Äôm not old (24) so this is not a ‚Äúback in my day‚Äù rant."

""The spirit from this team, they can deal with setbacks so we did, it is really great and shows your mentality - we have really improved on that.

""We have the right characters and now it is about cooperation, deal with set backs but also improve - we have to stay calm, stay composed and play our game.

""You can see that Arsenal are more together, more routines - but our team spirit brings us the win.

""We can still do things better, with pressing, we had a good plan but the incoming from Zinchenko for instance, that gives them overnumbering in midfeld. We can be more composed on the ball, don't give it away away

""When we got beat in the press we fought back and recovered, especially in transitions we were good.""

On Antony and Marcus Rashford: ""They both played great, a continual threat, I know our offensive is really strong - they are creative and have speed. This is the first time they have played together and this performance is great to see.""

&#x200B;

# Erik ten Hag speaking to Sky Sports:

## 'I like this mentality'

&#x200B;

""I thought the first 10 minutes was the best we have played so far this season. But after the cancelled goal it wasn't as good. But we had a good team today, good team spirit, they fought, they recovered, Arsenal created chances but we scored great goals, we were great on the break.""

**On Arsenal's threat:** ""Not worried, I know our defence can deal with that but they have a lot of creativity. We could've done things better but we are not as long together as Arsenal. When we get that in we will have better control of the game, that's hard work, there's a lot of room for improvement.

""We had a good plan, we didn't get it all on the pitch, we couldn't control it when we should have. We got a set back and we fight back, that's good to see. I like this mentality.

""Arsenal played well but we defended well - I never had the feeling that they'd break us. They had a lot of movement and creativity but we defended as a team with all 11. We can have better pressing and organisation, we can control the game more, we can be better in possession with better composure n the ball then we will dictate the game even more. We haven't been together long so we'll work on it.""

&#x200B;

# Erik ten Hag on Sky Sports, speaking about his new signing Antony:

## 'It's a process'

&#x200B;

""We can make speed and creativity together, he will be a threat in the Premier League. We were missing a player on the right wing, \[Jadon\] Sancho and \[Marcus\] Rashford can play there but they prefer the left so now we have the missing link who can play well on the right. He did well but I think he can do better, he had a great goal but all the goals were team goals.

""It's a process - you have to lift the standards every day. That is my demand and the players in our team have that demand, we have many players in the team who have won trophies and they have to bring that standard. Get the best out of them every day.

""We have to think about Europa League - today we will have a short celebration and tomorrow focus will be on the next game.""

&#x200B;

# Marcus Rashford

**Rashford: ""Togetherness is the big thing for me. You want to win these types of games. We have shown in the last few games being 1-0 up we can see games out. But we had to be more ruthless and this is something to work and build on."" #MUFC**

# Marcus Rashford, speaking to Sky Sports:

## 'We can be proud of ourselves'

&#x200B;

""It is always a big game against Arsenal, especially as they have had such a good start to the season. It was a big test for us today. We showed up and stood up to the challenge. We can be proud if ourselves. It is good to get into a rhythm.

""It is tough. They are a good team and know their principles of play and are very good at it. A good possession-based team and offer lots of difficulties with players dropping into pockets and with attacking threats. It is what we expected. I thought it was an even game. There were big spaces in the first half we couldn't exploit. We managed to do that in the second half.

""We have some excellent passers of the ball and as long as we make runs we are going to get the ball. We have to keep going for 90 minutes. There are a couple of times today we got through the press. It is important for us to keep going.""

Arteta on disallowed goal: ""There is a lack of consistency, very soft. Today (they adjudged) this was a foul. They wanted to pull the threshold because it is a big game, very difficult to understand."" #AFC [\#MUFC](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MUFC?src=hashtag_click)

Mikel Arteta, asked how the result might affect Arsenal confidence. ""It won‚Äôt happen. The performance was there.""

&#x200B;

# Mikel Arteta, speaking to Sky Sports:

## 'We should come here and win'

&#x200B;

""I am really disappointed to lose the game especially with the way it went over the 95 minutes. We had some big periods where we were totally dominant and in total control. We created chance after chance but did not close the game. In any moment, when they have open spaces, they are ging to hurt you.

""They had three big chances and scored three goals, we have numerous chances and we didn't score enough. We had a period in the first 18 minutes when we struggle and did not control the game but after that it was all us. We lose the ball in a really difficult place and play a ball in an area we don't have to and one pass and they are through.

""We should come here and win because of the way we play. Because of the performance and the way we dominated the game.""

**Does he feel vindicated more than disappointed?** ""100%""

**On the disallowed goal:** ""Lack of consistency. One is soft and last week they made a foul on Aaron but it is soft, it is not a foul. There is a foul on Bukayo, it is soft but not a penalty. Today it is a foul. The threshold in the first actions, you could see there is no yellow card because they want to keep a threshold in a big game. Really difficult to understand.""

&#x200B;

# Martin Odegaard

&#x200B;

Odegaard on disallowed goal: ""In my opinion it is never a foul. A soft challenge and for VAR to come in it has to be clear and obvious. Very, very soft. You can make it look worse on camera. Never a foul, the referee said play on."" #MUFC #AFC

This is a very very important distinction that must be understood to fully dissect how the MOASS will happen.

https://preview.redd.it/kutedirvjwl91.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b1f72cb5bf2f75992c3c729736aab814ecdf341

Creating a fake title for a car that does *not* exist and using it to secure a loan: is a fake.

Using a title for an authentic car that *does* exist and securing loans from a plethora of banks using it: is illegal.

https://preview.redd.it/czifiuyojwl91.jpg?width=730&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5acd1486259cfcd4dd020167beb84782f0e4df5

Both are **fraud**, but separate types of crimes with separate types of protections in securities industry.

&#x200B;

Loans issued with nonexistent collateral cause the applicant (Short Hedge Funds) to be responsible for both the crime and being on the hook for the legally mandated delivery of funds.

Loans issued with ***authentic and existing*** collateral (The Float) cause the applicant (**Short Hedge Funds**) to be on the hook for the crime while the issuer (*Broker Dealers: ex. BofA, WF, MS, JPM)* is on the hook for the legally mandated delivery of funds.

Short Hedge Funds knew, if this house of cards ever came falling down, they would be positioned to take the hit for the crime: *Which is a fine*, while the trillion dollar companies taking those bets would either be bailed out by taxpayers or fail independently from themselves.

&#x200B;

This behavior has and will continue to happen unabated until the float is fully Directly Registered with GME through ComputerShare. Although this fact is set in stone people don't understand why the float needs to be registered as explained above.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Glass-Steagall

* The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 effected a separation between commercial and investment banking activities. Prior to its implementation, J.P. Morgan & Co. operated in commercial banking and securities activities. Afterward, it split into investment bank Morgan Stanley and commercial bank JPMorgan.
* After decades of erosion, two provisions of the Act were repealed in 1999 by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act under then President Clinton's administration. It allowed for universal banking under one structure.
* The repeal ushered in a period of mega-mergers. The new six largest banks grew their assets from 20% of GDP in 1997 to over 60% of GDP in 2008.
* The percentage of borrowers who defaulted on their mortgages nearly doubled from 2006 to late 2007, in large part due to imprudent lending standards.
* Debate has centered around whether Glass-Steagall's absence led to a decline in underwriting standards. A study found that securities issued through universal banks had ""a significantly higher default rate"" compared to those issued by investment companies.

All of these institutions are now incestuously connected after the recall of Glass-Steagall. However connected, the behind the scenes struggle between the best interest for the investment side vs the banking side has led business decisions since 1999. The real estate crisis of 2008 was caused by the banking side under underwriting applicants and thus creating a bubble that popped. Many banking executives passed the financial buck to the investment executives who had made bets on these Mortgage backed securities on the good word of their peers. 

Fast forward to 2020 and the banking side is dealing with historically low interest rates and the investment sides of these companies saw an opportunity to over leverage themselves with what they saw as sure bets of shorting companies during covid to make extreme profits. This greed turned to gold blindness as they sought to leverage themselves to an even greater degree after cellar boxing vulnerable companies with industry plants and expensive ""third party"" marketing firms that tank the company even further. When DFV saw this happening he started a snowball into an avalanche that brought down that leverage on top of them like thousands of pounds of dirt on a hastily dug mine. Now the Short Hedge Funds and the internal investment community within these trillion dollar companies are throwing the taxpayers and the banking underwriting side under the bus as a payback for the Banking sides actions dating back to 2006. 

&#x200B;

TLDR:

&#x200B;

Loans issued with ***authentic and existing*** collateral (The Float) cause the applicant (**Short Hedge Funds**) to be on the hook for the crime while the issuer (*Broker Dealers: ex. BofA, WF, MS, JPM)* is on the hook for the legally mandated delivery of funds.

I never thought Kip Sabian was anything special.  I thought his ""bad boy"" gimmick was just some guy in a leather jacket trying to be cool.  When he went away, I never missed him.  When I heard them bring up his name a few weeks ago I thought.... fuckin get off my screen.

But.... my god I sure as hell am in on this new Kip Sabian.  The insane man talking to a box is great.  He seems to be a bit bulkier, which helps his believability.  He even seems to have a more gritty in ring style.  Props to Kip for coming up with this new gimmick and getting me more intrigued/inested in him in 1 match than all of his first run ever did.  I'm definitely intrigued to see where he takes it."

[https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/issues/Corporate-Actions-Transformation/ISO\_20022\_EntAlloc\_UG.pdf](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/issues/Corporate-Actions-Transformation/ISO_20022_EntAlloc_UG.pdf)

Page 15 on that page is the code DVSE for a stock dividend.

[https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/issues/Corporate-Actions-Transformation/2021/Corporate-Action-Announcements-Data-Dictionary-SR2021.xlsx](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/issues/Corporate-Actions-Transformation/2021/Corporate-Action-Announcements-Data-Dictionary-SR2021.xlsx)

Look at the tabs down the bottom once you have downloaded the xls file.

Choose the events tab down the bottom and scroll to column 104.

Read it. STOCK DIVIDEND.

Not column 105 and 106, both of those are stock split, but not via dividend.

Then also choose the tab down to bottom that says EVENT DESCRIPTIONS.

Please read column 82,83 and 84 for Stock Dividend and Stock Split.

They did this to avoid the bill fail tracking system perhaps.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wfg2vj/i\_think\_i\_found\_why\_did\_the\_dtcc\_performed\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wfg2vj/i_think_i_found_why_did_the_dtcc_performed_a/)

It should have been performed under the DVSE ISO code but was not due to this rule they are trying to avoid is my greatest understanding

The forward stock split code of FC-02 can be used.

Edit to include - [https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2013/3/22/0424-13.pdf](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/pdf/2013/3/22/0424-13.pdf)

Not saying it is FRAUD, but if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, looks like a duck...

Edit,  And if anyone has ANY documents, where they can reference i am wrong, i will update this post to include said evidence.

Edit post to remove the word split. Context is hard. Words hard. Apologies for any confusion"

Even my wife, which as a very little knowing of the sport, was asking why they pit Mick on the mediums at the same time as the soft runners. It happens regularly that the HAAS qualify in the Top 10 but bin it in the race with their tire choice. If I would play F1 Manager drunk while masturbating, I would come up with a better strategy and im sure everyone else here too."

"An interesting fact that is getting overlooked in the debate around IndyCar drivers and their elegibility for Formula 1 Super License: under the current regulations Romain Grosjean and Marcus Ericsson, ex-F1 drivers, wouldn't qualify for a Formula 1 Super License (and it isn't even close).",formula1,321,x5uqu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/x5uqu7/an_interesting_fact_that_is_getting_overlooked_in/,120,1662317996.0,"40 points over the last 3 seasons would be needed for a F1 Super License. This are the points gained by Grosjean and Ericsson.

* **Ericsson**

2020 - 0 points (12th position)

2021 - 6 points (6th position)

2022 - 10 points (4th position)

TOTAL - 16 points

Ericcson is racing for Ganassi Racing, which over the last 3 season has been the best team in IndyCar, and he's overperforming this year thanks to a series of consistent finishes and a Indy 500 win in a race of attrition that awards 2x the points of a regular IndyCar race. Even then, he's got less than half the points needed to get a F1 Super License.

* **Grosjean**

2021 - 0 points (15th position)

2022 - 0 points (14th position)

TOTAL - 0 points

Grosjean only has 2 season of IndyCar under his belt, so in theory he could still qualify for a Super License next year by winning the IndyCar championship (as likely as Aston Martin winning the Constructor Championship in F1 next year), but as things stand he would have actually have 0 points for the Super License.

I wanted to highlight this fact because Ericsson and Grosjean both showed to be competent F1 drivers for many years, but with the current F1 Super License system they would be less worthy of Formula 1 than drivers like Nikita Mazepin.

I think this was an interest experiment to show how broken is the SL system.

EDIT: *to make it clear, I know Ericcson and Grosjean have a Super License, what I am saying is that their IndyCar results would not allow them to qualify for a SL even if they proved in the past to be F1-caliber drivers.*"
